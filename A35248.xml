            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is no Perſon of any Age or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, but muſt needs acknowledge that the laſt Forty Years has been as it were an Age of <hi>Prodigies</hi> and Wonders in theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ſo that it may be no former time can parallel ſo many ſtrange Tranſactations as have happened in ſo little ſpace, and therefore as an Ingenious Perſon ſays
<q>
                  <l>A Book of Prodigies is fit</l>

            </p>
            <p>And another Learned Author ſays, The wiſe Creator of Heaven and Earth is wont, when the meaſure of our wickedneſs comes to the height, rather to inflict upon us Temporal, than Eternal puniſhments, and to uſe for our Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Occaſion of theſe Natural Effects, thereby to affright us from the Terrour of thoſe ſights to a Repentance, and dutiful reſpect of him; And if we conſult Hiſtory, we ſhall find, that there hath never been any notable Apparition or Prodigy ſeen in the Heavens, but it hath been attended in the ſequel with more than Ordinary Changes or Troubles here on Earth; Neither is
<pb facs="tcp:50774:3"/>there any one except he hath no Religion, who is not affrighted at Lightning, the claſhing noiſe of Thunder, or an horrible Comet; For God ſpeaks to men not only with the Tongues of men by Prophets, Apoſtles, and Teachers, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo by the Elements, and other Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſigns in the <hi>Heavens, Earth,</hi> or <hi>Sea;</hi>

            <head>The Surprizing Miracles of Nature in the <hi>Heavens, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Waters.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>STrange and Wonderful have been the Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Productions of Nature in all Ages, or rather of the God of Nature, and Divine Providence: St. <hi>Auflin,</hi> that Famous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father of the Church, defineth Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be thoſe things which happen beyond the Expectation, or thought of the Beholder, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets in him a Miraculous Contemplation, yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times horrour and amazement; whereof there are two kinds, True and Falſe; the falſe Miracles are ſuch as are not really as they ſeem to be, but meerly acted by the Power of Nature, although obſcure and hid; The True are performed by the Power of God, above and beyond all the Faculties of created Nature, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to procure Admiration, and partly to confirm the Faith of Men; ſuch were the bringing back of the ſhadow Ten Degrees in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> for <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> A Virgin to conceive with Child, and yet remain a Virgin: To draw water out of a hard Rock: To cauſe the Sea to divide aſunder; The Sun to ſtand ſtill: To cauſe Manna to fall from Heaven: To turn Water into Wine; and many of the like kind recorded in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50774:4"/>the Holy Scriptures; And theſe were formerly uſed for the Confirming of the Faith both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but are not now neceſſary, ſince the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets, Evangeliſts and Apoſtles are ſo generally preached unto all.</p>
            <p>Yet hath not the Almighty left himſelf without Witneſs, nor mankind without warnings of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments, and Deſolations, by <hi>Prodigious Signs, and Wonderful Appearances</hi> in all times of the World; thereby if poſſible, to deter them from their Evil Practices, and to induce them to repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; of which the very Heathens were ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for we may find in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, that there never happened any Remarkable Prodigy, but the People of every Sex, Age, and Quality, flockt, and ran to their Temples and Altars, making Prayers, and offering Sacrifices to their Gods for appeaſing, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying their incenſed Wrath; which may condemn the neglect and Contempt that is in thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to own the true Chriſtian Religion, and may teach us to repair to the true God, and implore his mercy and forbearance of pouring his Wrath upon us; In order whereunto it cannot ſurely be unſeaſonable, nor unprofitable to Collect out of very approved Authors, the moſt Remarkable Prodigies or Miracles that have appeared cither in the Heavens, Earth, or Waters, for ſome Thouſands of years in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and many other parts of the World; with the Tremendous Conſequences that have ſucceeded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, as to Wars, Fires, Famines, and other dreadful Calamities in ſeveral Nations; upon ſome of which the Famous <hi>Dubartas</hi> thus Ingeniouſly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>page</hi> 14.</p>

In <hi>Hetruria</hi> the Heavens were ſeen to burn; In the City of <hi>Arimini</hi> 3 Moons were ſeen in one night by the Inhabitants; all theſe Prodigies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared about the end of the firſt <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War; In the ſecond War, after <hi>Hanno</hi> was overcome by <hi>Scipio,</hi> a Child of a Month old was heard to cry in the Street, <hi>Triumphi, Triumphi:</hi> In the Fields, near <hi>Rome,</hi> Ships were diſcerned in the Sky, and Men in long White Garments were perceived to march towards each other, but never to meet: It likewiſe rained Stones, and the Sun and Moon were ſeen as it were to juſtle each other; and in the day, two Moons appeared in the Heavens; At <hi>Phalaſcis</hi> the Heavens ſeemed to be rent in ſunder, and at <hi>Capua</hi> the Moon ſeemed to burn, and to bend down towards the Earth; A Green Palm-Tree in <hi>Naples</hi> took Fire, and burned away to Aſhes; At <hi>Mantua</hi> a little Rivulet was turned into blood, and at <hi>Rome</hi> it rained blood: An Ox was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heard to ſpeak theſe Words, <hi>Cave tibi Roma; Rome look to thy ſelf.</hi> Soon after, ſeveral large, tall Ships appeared upon the River of <hi>Taracina</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> The Sun at divers times appeared of a bloody colour, many Temples and Houſes in <hi>Rome</hi> were beaten down with Thunderbolts from Heaven, ſome of the Cities
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50774:5"/>Enſigns, or Field-Colours were obſerved to ſweat Blood; Two Suns appeared in the Heavens, at one time; It likewiſe rained Milk and Stones: A Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met in the form of a burning Torch was diſcerned to reach from the Eaſt to the Weſt. In the <hi>Vileter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Fields the Earth rent aſunder in ſuch huge and frightful breaches, that Trees, and whole Houſes were ſwallowed up in it, and it rained blood for two whole days together, about which time <hi>Hannibal</hi> received that notable overthrow by <hi>Scipio,</hi> which was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the famous City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the Conqueſt of that Countrey to the <hi>Romans.

            <p n="7">VII. In the Sixty Seventh year after the Birth of our Saviour, and about the Fortieth after, the <hi>Jews</hi> had with cruel hands crucifyed the Lord of Life, that innocent blood which they deſired might fall upon them and their Children, began to be revenged upon them; for ſoon after the <hi>Romans</hi> came, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50774:10"/>burnt down, and deſtroyed the City and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and kil'd multitudes of them, as by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel will appear; but before theſe woful Deſolations happened, there wanted not Prodigious Signs, and warnings from Heaven of their Approaching Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: For the year before <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> came againſt them, there was ſeen a Star over the Temple ſo bright, as if a man had held many drawn ſwords in his hand; And at the ſame time which was the Paſſover, that whole night the Temple was light and clear as at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and continued ſo ſeven nights together; which wiſe men underſtood to be a very ill Prognoſtick, though others thought it good. A Sword, and other Inſtruments of War were ſeen hanging in the Air di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over the City, very dreadful to behold. The ſame time likewiſe they brought a Heifer for a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which when ſhe was knocked down, ſhe calved a Lamb; beſides there was a certain Gate, called the <hi>Eaſt-gate,</hi> which could never be opened or ſhut with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Twenty men, and the creaking of the hinges might be heard afar off; This Gate was found open without any mans help, and they could not ſhut it, till a great number joyned their ſtrength; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there was diſcerned on the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or <hi>Holies of Holies,</hi> a whole night long the face of a man very terrible. There appeared alſo at the ſame time four Chariots with Horſemen fighting fiercely againſt each other, and great Blaſts of Fire in the sky coming toward <hi>Jeruſalem; In the Feaſt of weeks</hi> the Prieſts heard a man walking in the Temple, and ſaying with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful terrible voice; <hi>Come let us go away out of this Temple; let us make haſte away from hence;</hi> At that time alſo there was this writing found graven on an old Stone, <hi>At what time the building of the Temple ſhall be brought to a four ſquare, then it ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> Now when the Temple was beſieged, and the Walls bruiſed, the <hi>Jews</hi> making haſte to repair the Ruins, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the old writing, they made the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple four ſquare; Theſe words were likewiſe found in

            <p>Theſe were the dreadful Preſages of their enſuing Calamities, which never ended till the whole People were almoſt utterly deſtroyed, and they ceaſed to be any more a Nation, which ſad Judgment remains upon them to this day, and whereof I ſhall here give a brief Account; The beginning of their troubles hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the time of King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> during whoſe Reign, the Wars began between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> which never ceaſed, till the people of <hi>Judea</hi> were led captive into the Provinces of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Temple was made deſolate, the riſe whereof was on this occaſion. In the Twentieth year of his Reign the ninth day of the Firſt Moneth, which is <hi>July, Nero,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> ſent a Preſent for a Burnt Offering to be offered at the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> requiring peace of the Elders of <hi>Judea and Jeruſalem,</hi> and that they would enter into League with him, ſaying, <hi>My requeſt is that you would offer my Preſent to the Lord your God, for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Religion pleaſeth me very well; therefore I deſire you to joyn in Friendſhip with me, according as you have done with the Emperors of</hi> Rome, <hi>my Predeceſſors in time paſt; I have heard what</hi> Caſſius <hi>the Captain of mine Army hath done to you, which diſpleaſeth me out of meaſure, wherefore I aſſure unto you a faithful League, by the Conſent and Counſel of the Senate of</hi> Rome, <hi>that hereafter there ſhall never any</hi> Roman <hi>Captain ſtir hand or foot againſt you, but rather your Magiſtrates, Rulers, and Judges, ſhall be all</hi> Jews, <hi>and of</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>Yea</hi> Agrippa <hi>your King ſhall be Lord of all your Rulers, and what he commands, you ſhall do it; the</hi> Romans <hi>ſhall only be called your Lords, and ſhall have no more to do with you.</hi>

            <p>When theſe Embaſſadors came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they delivered their <hi>Meſſage</hi> to <hi>Anani</hi> the Prieſt, and placed

            <p>To whom <hi>Eleazar</hi> replyed, <hi>Why takeſt thou upon thee the Name of King? If thou be a King, why doſt not thou

Come thou and they together and chaſten us, that it may appear whether thou indeed be a King or no; Thou ſtandeſt afar off, and when thou ſpeakeſt, thy Feet are ready to run away, as if a Dog ſhould ſet himſelf againſt an armed Man, and bark at him, lolling out his Tongue.</hi> And upon this he winked upon the Rebels his Companions to ſeize upon <hi>Agrippa,</hi> which was obſerved by a ſpy appointed by the King for that purpoſe, who laying his hand upon his head, gave a ſign to the King to flee away immediately, or elſe, the Seditious would deſtroy both him and them together; <hi>Agrippa</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this, got away with all ſpeed, the Rebels pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him, but in vain; for he got into <hi>Japho</hi> a Town under the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he was in ſafety; from thence he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave an account to <hi>Nero</hi> both of the ſedition, and the ſlighting of his Offering; whereupon <hi>Nero</hi> joyned him with <hi>Caſſius</hi> to command a great Army, wherewith they entred <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and won many walled Towns, and raſed <hi>Japho,</hi> leaſt it ſhould fall into the hands of the Enemy; After this they marched toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſigning utterly to deſtroy the Rebels; which <hi>Eltaſer,</hi> and other Prieſts having notice of, they iſſued out againſt them, and found them incamped in the way between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Japho,</hi> where many of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſlain by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the reſidue <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> put to flight, and following the Chaſe to the Gates of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> beſieged the City three days; The Fourth day the Prieſts and People iſſued out ſuddenly, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, upon the Camp of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſlew five Thouſand Footmen, and a Thouſand Horſemen, <hi>Caſſius</hi> perceiving that neither he nor his could eſcape, choſe out Forty Thouſand of his beſt Souldiers, and placed them between his Camp, and the Prieſts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to ſtand all the night ſounding their Trumpets, and making of Fires, and not to remove out of their places till the morning, that hereby, he and <hi>Agrippa</hi> might eſcape; The <hi>Jews</hi> hearkning to

            <p>But <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> got ſafe into the Town, from whence they went together to <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave an Account of their ill ſucceſs to <hi>Nero,</hi> who ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and his Son <hi>Titus</hi> to revenge the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> on the <hi>Jews,</hi> commanding them to raſe their walled Cities, and deſtroy whatever they found, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſparing either Man, Woman, Child, Infants, ſucking Babes, or Old Folks, but to ſlay all; The <hi>Jews</hi> having Intelligence of this, choſe out three Captains, <hi>Joſephus</hi> the writer of this Hiſtory, <hi>Anani</hi> and <hi>Eleaſar</hi> his Son, to be their Captains, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> firſt invaded <hi>Galilee,</hi> which being the lot that fell to <hi>Joſeph</hi> to defend, he departed from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thither, and built up the Towns that were deſtroyed, repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Walls, Gates, Bars, and Pallaces; ordaining alſo Captains over the People to lead and govern them, ſome of Thouſands, and ſome of Hundreds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He inſtructed the People alſo in the Feats of War, and chuſing out Threeſcore Thouſand Footmen, and ſome Horſemen, he marched to the Cities of <hi>Agrippa</hi> that were in <hi>Judea,</hi> becauſe he joyned with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> with all the power he could make; <hi>Joſeph</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt approached <hi>Tiara,</hi> a great City that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> where his Treaſure, and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all his Jewels were, and offered Peace to the Inhabitants upon Condition they would open their Gates, and deliver him all the Riches and Treaſures of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> which if they would do, they ſhould be ſafe in their Perſons and Eſtates; upon theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they opened the Gates, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> commanded about Six Hundred Wicked Perſons in the Town to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50774:12"/>be laid in Irons, and others who had aided <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> to be put to the Sword; But the chief Governour of the Town he apprehended alive, and carrying him out of the City, commanded one of the Souldiers to cut off his hands; The Governour then beſought <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaying, <hi>I beſeech thee my Lord let one of my hands only be cut off, and ſpare the other;</hi> At which <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> laughed him to ſcorn, not judging him a man of courage; <hi>Joſeph</hi> then bid them give him his ſword in his own hands, and to let him cut off which hand he would; The <hi>Roman</hi> Captain took the Sword, and cut off his left hand, leaving himſelf the Right, and ſo he was let go, who went preſently to the Camp of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> declaring what ſhame was done unto him.</p>
            <p>After this the City of <hi>Zippory</hi> made a League with <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> of which <hi>Joſeph</hi> being certifyed, he marched thither with his Army, but the Town endured the aſſault, ſo that <hi>Joſeph</hi> could not prevail againſt it, and therefore beſieged it a long while; In the mean time <hi>Askalon</hi> revolted from the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was thereupon beſieged by ſome <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but <hi>Antonius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Captain iſſuing out one morning before day, fell upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Camp, and before day light, had ſlain above Ten Thouſand <hi>Jews;</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſent Eighteen Thouſand Men more to <hi>Askalon</hi> to bury the bodies of the <hi>Jews</hi> that that were ſlain, which they did without the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who kept themſelves within the Town for fear of them; Then <hi>Joſeph</hi> gathering all his Forces together, aſſaulted <hi>Askelon</hi> with his whole Army, and won it, ſlaying afterward <hi>Anthony</hi> and all his People with the Sword, ſo that few or none eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; He likewiſe burnt all the Villages and Hamlets about the Town, and in all other Places which had entred League with the <hi>Romans,</hi> he flew both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and burnt their Houſes to the ground; This done <hi>Joſeph</hi> returned again to <hi>Zippory,</hi> fought with them, and conquered them, burning their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Villages, and leading their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

            <p>Then <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> ſent ſeveral Noblemen as Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who thus addreſſed themſelves to him; Veſpaſian, <hi>General of the</hi> Roman <hi>Army ſends to know what it will avail you to be thus blockt up in a walled Town, he deſires rather that you would come forth, and treat peaceably with him, and enter into a League together, for it will be for your benefit to ſerve</hi> Caeſar <hi>Emperor of</hi> Rome, <hi>whereby you may live, and not be deſtroyed, nor any of your People;</hi> Then <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> deſiring Truce for a few days, to conſult with the People about this matter; which he agreed to, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent to the chief Prieſts and Rulers of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the reſt of the People the following Letter; <hi>Ye ſhall underſtand Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that</hi> Veſpaſian <hi>General of the</hi> Romans, <hi>ſent his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors unto me inquiring what it would avail me to be obſtinate againſt them, and not rather to come forth and treat of Peace, and to joyn in League together, that we may ſerve the Emperor of the</hi> Romans, <hi>ſo that we may ſave our lives, and not be deſtroyed; And I beſeech ye, why will you loſe your lives, with the lives of your Wives, your Sons, and your Daughters?

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50774:15"/>pleaſure, ſince they muſt dye for Thirſt; He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon took Garments, and dipped them in the Well-waters in the Town, and hanged them over the Walls in ſeveral places to declare they had plenty of Water.

            <p>But <hi>Joſeph</hi> perceiving the War to increaſe dayly, he iſſued out with his Forces, and made a great ſlaughter in the Camp of the <hi>Romans,</hi> burning the Mount and Engines of War they had left behind them, and forcing them to retire from the Walls; <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> perceiving his men ſhrink, ſtood up and encouraged them ſo much with good Words and large Promiſes of Gold and Silver, that they continued the Fight againſt <hi>Joſeph</hi> till night; In the hear of the Battel, the <hi>Jews</hi> wounded <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> in the Right beg with an Arrow, which much diſmayed the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſee the blood run down: <hi>Titus</hi> ſeeing his Father wounded, was much diſturbed, and ran to help him; to whom his Father ſaid, <hi>How comes it my Son that thou art ſo much aſtoniſhed, Take heart to thee, and with undaunted Courage revenge thy Father upon the Jews, who have now the better of us.</hi> The Fight was that day exceeding bloody on both ſides, very few being left of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Party, who returned into the Town.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50774:16"/>it happened that a great ſtone ſtruck a Woman with Child with ſuch violence, that it paſſed through her body, and carried the Child with it the ſpace of half a mile; another ſtone hit one of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with ſuch force, that it divided his head from his body, and made it fly a mile off; At the ſame time a <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier was got under the Wall, and juſt going to ſhoot <hi>Joſeph</hi> with an invenomed Arrow, which he eſpying, cryed out, <hi>Hold thy hand wicked fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and do not kill me;</hi> at which the man ſtarting aſide, the <hi>Jews</hi> out of the Town ſuddenly powred boyling Oyl on his Head from the Walls, whereby his skin was ſcalded off, and he ran away naked, howling and yelling to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, where he dyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and his Sun were fully reſolved to continue the ſiege, which had already laſted 47 days, and thoſe within the Town were ſo tired out, that they were no longer able to ſupply the watch upon the Walls, which <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> underſtanding, he and his Son <hi>Titus</hi> one night ſcaled the Walls in a place where the Watchmen were wanting, being followed by many other <hi>Roman</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who went down on the inſide, and breaking open the Great Gate of the Town, the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Army entred thereat, and then ſounded their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and an Alarum to battle; The <hi>Jews</hi> with the noiſe and Tumult awaked from ſleep very much afraid, however every man catcht up his Arms, and with all ſpeed repaired to the Market-place, which was made ſo large, that all the People of the City might upon occaſion meet together; As they were looking about, they ſaw the <hi>Roman</hi> Army marching through the great Gate toward them, whereupon they encouraged each other, ſaying, <hi>Let us dye here fighting, and never ſuffer our ſelves to be taken alive:</hi> and then they fell upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> but being overpowred, moſt of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were ſlain in the skirmiſh, they refuſing to yield or take quarter, becauſe they would not truſt the Faith of the <hi>Romans;</hi> For a while before a certain <hi>Jew</hi> beſought a <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier to ſave his Life, which

            <p>However, <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and Forty ſtout men his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions made their eſcape, and fled into a Wood, where they found a certain Cave, and hid themſelves therein; of which <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> having notice, ſent three Perſons to <hi>Joſeph</hi> to deſire him to come forth, and he ſhould have his Life, and not be ſlain; upon which <hi>Joſeph</hi> debated the matter with the reſt in the Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiring their advice; <hi>For my part</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if you will follow my Counſel, I think it beſt that we go to them, but upon this Condition; That they will give us ſuch full ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for our Lives as we ſhall require, which being done, I doubt not but</hi> Veſpaſian <hi>when we come to him, will extend his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to us;</hi> But they perceiving that <hi>Joſeph</hi> inclined to yield to the <hi>Romans,</hi> were very much diſturbed, and perſwaded him, <hi>That it would not be for his credit to ſave his life with the loſs of his Honour, and therefore reſolved to kill each other, and dye like men;</hi> and thereupon each man drew out his ſword, and came to him in the midſt of the Cave, ſaying, Joſeph <hi>our Prince hear thou; If thou wilt be ruled by us, we will firſt kill thee as our Lord, and a great Prince, and thou ſhalt chuſe what Death thou wilt dye, that thou mayſt dye Honourably; but if thou refuſe to dye bravely, aſſure thy ſelf of this, that every man of us will ſet upon thee, and kill thee: Joſeph</hi> endeavoured by many Arguments at large, to divert them from their wicked
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50774:17"/>purpoſe, as proceeding rather from deſperation and cowardiſe, than true Courage; But nothing would prevail, he therefore ſubtilly told them; <hi>My Brethren ſince you are determined to dye on your own ſwords, let us divide into Couples, and caſt Lots which Couple ſhall dye firſt, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Every man liked this advice, and deſired him to divide the Men, <hi>Joſeph</hi> anſwered, <hi>But let us ſwear by the Name of the Lord that this device ſhall ſtand:</hi> Which they accordingly did; Then <hi>Joſeph</hi> caſt Lots, who ſhould be the odd man, and it fell upon <hi>Jehoida</hi> a <hi>Galilean,</hi> a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man, and one of the chiefeſt Councellors of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and the principal perſwader of this wicked Fact to kill themſelves; After this he craftily divided them into Couples, ſo that the Lot of his own Couple came forth laſt of all, who hoped to be ſaved, truſting in God, and believing that he would deliver him from this abominable deed; Then <hi>Jehoida</hi> choſe him one of the firſt couple, who ſlew him; That done, the firſt couple caſt Lots between them, and the one killed his Fellow, and choſe him one of the ſecond couple to kill him, and in this manner did they all, till they were all ſlain, and none left alive but <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Fellow, who ſaid to <hi>Joſeph, Come let us caſt Lots, that we may go to our Brethren; Joſeph</hi> ſaid, <hi>We will do ſo if you be ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but firſt hear me a few words, have not theſe ſinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt God in thus murdering themſelves ſo ſhamefully, neither could I by any means diſſwade them, nor divert them from their opinion, why ſhould we ſin ſo grievouſly againſt God and our own ſouls; If thou ſay, how ſhall we do by reaſon of the Oath we have ſworn? Doſt thou not know that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50774:17"/>a wicked Oath is better broken than kept, and this is a breach of one of the Ten Commandments, which ſaith expreſly</hi> Thou ſhalt not kill. <hi>Now therefore my Brother if thou wilt be ruled by me, thouſhalt ſave both thy own Life and mine, For I will not caſt Lots, neither will I perform the Oath we have ſworn, as being directly contrary to the Law of God; but if thou wilt not, I will fight with thee, and kill thee, and ſpare my ſelf;</hi> And herewith <hi>Joſeph</hi> leapt back, and drew his Sword in his own defence, His Companion knowing <hi>Joſeph</hi> too ſtrong for him, ſtirred neither hand nor foot, but ſaid, <hi>Lo I am content, do what thou thinkeſt good, becauſe thou art a man of God, and half ſaved thine own life and mine.</hi>

            <p>After this <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> went into the Land of <hi>Edom,</hi> where he won two ſtrong Cities, and ſlew Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the People thereof, leading away the reſt into captivity; and at length came to <hi>Samaria</hi> and took it, and then repaired the VValls of all the Towns he had conquered, placing Garriſons therein to aid him, when he ſhould beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> He then returned to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and muſtered his whole Army in order to prepare for that ſiege; But in the mean time news came from <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour was dead, and it was at firſt reported, that while he was hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fire came down from Heaven upon him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him; After whom <hi>Galba</hi> reigned, but within one year he was ſlain by the Noblemen of <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> was made Emperor in his ſtead, he was a Fool, but yet a very bloody man, and much given to drunkenneſs, ſo that upon all accounts he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; the <hi>Roman</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility who were with <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> hearing this, were much offended, ſaying, <hi>Was there never a Nobleman in</hi> Rome <hi>leſt, to be placed in the Empire, but a drunken Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucker muſt be choſen; Why did they not rather Elect the mighty Prince</hi> Veſpaſian <hi>here with us, a wiſe and valiant Commander, who hath conquered many Cities, and vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed divers Warlike Nations; How many puiſſant Kings hath he ſubdued to the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, and how hath he enlarged it far and wide, And now when the Empire ought to have been beſtowed upon</hi> Veſpaſian, <hi>or ſome Perſon of the like merits, becauſe no ſuch could be found among them, they have beſtowed it upon a Fool, and a ſottiſh Drunkard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have done very undiſcreetly, however we are reſolved the Empire of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall ſuddenly have a better Emperor,

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50774:21"/>of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with her Men and Women Servants, for fear ſhe ſhould be killed for her Husbands ſake,) paſſed by the place of Ambuſhment, whom <hi>Jehochanan</hi> took, not a little proud of ſuch a prey, and carryed into the City, thinking <hi>Schimeon</hi> would comply upon any Terms to gain his Wife whom he dearly loved; This came to <hi>Schimeons</hi> ear juſt at the time he had taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Jehochanan</hi>'s men, and cut off their hands, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with ſuch ſhame to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to their Maſter; He likewiſe ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> to return his Wife, or upon refuſal he threatned him with the utmoſt Extremity, ſince he was reſolved to take the City ere long, and to <hi>Jehochanans</hi> ſhame would cut off the Hands and Legs of all the Inhabitants; <hi>Jehochanan</hi> being afraid, (<hi>Schimeon</hi> having with him Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Fighting men,) he ſent him his Wife, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he continued without the Town, while <hi>Jehochanan</hi> played the Tyrant within, his Souldiers raviſhing the Citizens Wives and Daughters, and ſhedding much innocent blood, and whoever complained was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſlain; ſo that the Condition of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was truly miſerably, for if any went out of the City, they were ſlain by <hi>Schimeon,</hi> and thoſe within were continually murdered by <hi>Jehochanan;</hi> The Citizens being therefore tyred by his Tyranny, aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and encountred with <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> where a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them were ſlain, and if the <hi>Edomites</hi> who were fled to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the Tyranny of <hi>Schimeon</hi> had not come in to their relief, the whole People of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been utterly deſtroyed, and ſlain every Mothers Son by <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> his power was ſo great. Then <hi>Anani</hi> the High Prieſt, and other Grave Men not being able to ſuffer the wickedneſs of <hi>Jehochanan</hi> any longer, reſolved to deliver the City to <hi>Schimeon,</hi> hoping he would ſlay <hi>Jehochanan;</hi> who was at length prevailed with, and promiſed to aſſiſt them againſt the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but being entred with his whole Army, he broke his promiſe, and joyned himſelf with <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> ſo that theſe two Rebels reigned in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by courſe,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50774:22"/>one of them one Moneth, and the other another; yet within two days they quarrelled about <hi>Eleaſar</hi> the Prieſt, whom <hi>Schimeon</hi> would have ſlain, but <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> defended, ſo that ever after they fought one againſt the other.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions at <hi>Jeruſalem, Veſpaſian</hi> had ſent two Noblemen to <hi>Rome</hi> to make away the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Vitellius,</hi> whereby he might come and receive the Imperial Crown there; They went therefore, and raiſed an Army, wherewith they fell upon <hi>Vitellius</hi> and ſlew him, though not without much oppoſition, for there were ſlain that day in <hi>Rome</hi> eighty Thouſand va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Souldiers; Then <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> taking half his Army with him, left the other part with <hi>Titus</hi> his Son to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but to continue at <hi>Alexandria</hi> till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order; to whom <hi>Titus</hi> at his departing ſaid, <hi>I ſhall do dear Father according to your Commandment, for to you it belongeth to command, and to me to obey; Veſpaſian</hi> took with him <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Menas</hi> his Son, with <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Prieſt, for fear they ſhould raiſe a Rebellion; As he approached nigh <hi>Rome,</hi> all the Citizens came forth to meet him, and received him with great Joy, and mighty ſhews and Triumphs; and ſoon after he was ſolemnly crowned Emperor; within a few days <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was diſpleaſed with King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain falſe Informations that he deſigned ſome diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, upon which both he and his Son <hi>Munabas</hi> were put to Death.</p>
            <p>This happened three years and an half before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at which time the continual Sacrifice ceaſed for One Thouſand, Two Hundred and Ninety days, as it is written in the 12 of <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecy; But <hi>Joſeph</hi> was by the clemency of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> ſet at Liberty, and ſent to <hi>Titus</hi> (who was then at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>) with Letters from his Father, and was kindly received by him; <hi>Titus</hi> ſoon after marched with a mighty Army to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> where he ſtayd till the Winter was paſt, before he would beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But in the mean time the quarrels and murders in that

            <p>Then had the continual Sacrifice ceaſed Thirty ſix days, for even till that time, ſome good men or other in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtill offered Sacrifice to the Lord; But now when the Prieſts had laid the Sacrifice on the Altar, the ſeditious would run upon them and kill them, ſo that the Prieſts and the Beaſts they would have Sacrificed, fell down dead to the ground to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo they likewiſe deſtroyed all that came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After this in the firſt year of the Reign of <hi>Veſpaſian, Titus</hi> his Son muſtered his men in the Plain of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and he found them a vaſt number, ſo that they

            <p>Theſe Prodigies (ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi>) are ſufficient to prove the truth of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, but what I ſhall now declare, being very wonderful will further confirm them, which I ſhall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50774:29"/>relate as I find them in the Archives and Records, as followeth; when the Foundations of this New Temple were laying, there was a ſtone to which the bottom of the Foundation was faſtened, that ſlipt from its place, and diſcovered the Mouth of a Cave which had been cut in the Rock; Now when they could not ſee to the bottom by reaſon of its depth, the Overſeers of the work being deſirous to find the bottom, tyed a long Rope to one of the Labourers, and let him down into it; being come to the bottom, there was water therein up to his Ankles, and ſearching every part of that hollow place, he found it to be fourſquare, as far as he could conjecture by feeling, then returning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Mouth of it, he happened upon a little Pillar not much higher than the water, and laying his hand on it, found a book thereon, wrapt up in a piece of thin clean Linnen, which taking up he gave notice by ſhaking the rope to be drawn forth, which done, he ſhewed them the book, which ſtruck them with admiration, becauſe it ſeemed very freſh and untoucht, though found in ſo dark and obſcure an hole; The Book being unfolded and opened, ſurprized not only the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the <hi>Graecians,</hi> for they found in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereof theſe words written in Capital Letters; IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD, AND THE WORD WAS GOD; And to ſpeak truly, ſaith the Hiſtorian, that Scripture did plainly and manifeſtly contain the whole Goſpel, which the Divine Tongue of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Diſciple St. <hi>John</hi> had declared; This together with the other Miracles which at that time were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from Heaven, did demonſtrate that not any word of our Lord ſhould fall to the ground which had foretold the utter deſolation both of the Temple and City of <hi>Jeruſalem.

            <p>Thus ſeverely were the Judgments of Heaven exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> which did not yet end here, but continued to their poſterity; For in 434. The <hi>Jews</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Creet</hi> were deluded by the Devil,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50774:30"/>affirming himſelf to be <hi>Moſes,</hi> who led the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and perſwaded thoſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>That he was ſent from God to lead them through the Sea to their own Countrey the holy Land;</hi> This theſe poor Creatures ſoon believed, and diſpoſing of all their Goods to others according to his perſwaſion, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this ſeducer, who had ſpent a whole year in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one City to another; he then led them with their Wives and Children to the top of a ſteep Rock that hung over the Sea; when they were come hither, this Mock <hi>Miſes</hi> commanded them to wrap their heads in their upper Garments, and ſo to throw themſelves from the Rock into the Sea, aſſuring them of a ſafe Paſſage, they readily obeyed him, and in that manner a great many of them periſhed in the Waves, and more would have followed, had it not pleaſed God that ſome Chriſtian Fiſhermen were there at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, who took up many of them as they were flooting upon the waters, and ready to periſh; Theſe afterward returning to the reſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> told them how they had been cheated and deceived, and how narrowly they had eſcaped; whereupon they being upon good reaſon all very much inraged, ſought far and near for this ſeducer to put him to death; but when he could not poſſibly be found any where, they thereupon fully concluded, That it was the Devil himſelf, the old man ſlayer, who had appeared to them in humane ſhape, and divers of the <hi>Jews</hi> being moved by this Calamity, became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>Euſebius Hiſt.</hi>

The antient Pilgrims of <hi>Mahomets</hi> race (who after they had viſited this place never uſe to cut their Hair) were much amazed, becauſe they could not concieve the meaning of this Viſion, only one of the Dervices or Prieſts (which is a ſtrict Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Order among the <hi>Turks</hi> like the <hi>Capuchins</hi> among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and live in Contemplation) ſtepped up very boldly, and made the following Speech to the Company,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the World had never but Three true Religions, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which had a Prophet; Firſt God choſe the</hi> Jews, <hi>and did wonders for them in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and brought them forth by their Prophet</hi> Moſes, <hi>who preſcribed them a Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would have maintained them, if they had not been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and rebellious, and fallen to Idolatry, whereupon he gave them over, and ſcattered them upon the face of the Earth; Then preſently after God raiſed a new Prophet, who taught the Chriſtian Religion: This good man the</hi> Jews <hi>condemned, and Crucified for a Seducer of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being not moved with the piety of his Life, his great
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50774:52"/>miracles, nor his Doctrine: yet after his death, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a few Fiſhermen did ſo move the hearts of men, that the Great Monarchs of the world bowed to his very Title, and yielded to the commands of his Miniſters; But it ſeems they in proceſs of time grew as corrupt as the</hi> Jews, <hi>their Church being disjointed with the Title of</hi> Eaſtern, <hi>and</hi> Weſtern, <hi>committing Idolatry again by ſetting up Images, with many other idle Ceremonies, beſides the corruption of their Lives, ſo that God was weary of them too, and not only ſent diviſions among them, but forſook them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt them of their chiefeſt Cities,</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople; <hi>Yet God is ſtill the Governour of the world, and himſelf hath raiſed up another Prophet and People, even our great</hi> Mahomet, <hi>giving way to our Nation, ſo as no doubt we ſhall be happy for ever, if we can ſerve this God aright, and take warning by the fall of others; But alas! I tremble to ſpeak it, we have erred in every point, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully broke our firſt Inſtitutions, ſo that God hath manifeſted his wrath by evident Signs and Tokens, keeping our Prophet from us who prefixed a time to return with all happineſs to his People, ſo as there are now forty years paſt by our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; wherefore this ſtrange and fearful viſion is a predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome great Troubles and Alterations; For either the opening of the Book in the womans hand doth foretell our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off from the firſt intent of our Law, whereat theſe armed men departed, as confounded with the guilt of their own Conſciences; Or elſe it ſignifies ſome other book wherein we have not yet read, and againſt which no power ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: So that I fear our Religion will be proved corrupt, and our Prophet an Impoſtor, and then this Chriſt whom they talk of, ſhall ſhine like the Sun, and ſet up his Name ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly;</hi> Hitherto the Company was ſilent, but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſpeak ſo boldly, they were much incenſed againſt him, charging him with Blaſphemy, which their Law makes a Capital Crime; whereupon they preſently condemned him, and having obtained the <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> conſent and warrant, they put him to death; The Truth of this Relation was confirmed by <hi>Iſuf Chaous</hi> a converted Turk, who came to <hi>London</hi> about
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50774:52"/>the year 1656 which viſion, he ſaid, did much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him, but he added, that the grand Seignior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded none ſhould ſpeak of it upon pain of death.

            <p>The next morning the <hi>Swedes</hi> found the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had left all their Great Guns behind them, there were ſlain of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Three Thouſand, and of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> about Four Thouſand upon the place, beſides which the Boors killed near a Thouſand more of them who fled ſtragling away; The wounded were as many more as the ſlain, on the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſide were loſt the King himſelf whoſe death can never be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lamented, his enemies themſelves giving him this Honourable Teſtimony, <hi>That he was the braveſt Enemy, and the beſt Captain that ever was in Chriſtendom,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> found themſelves to have gotten but a doleful, and a woful victory, loſing that incomparable Conqueror, who was alone worth many hundreds of others; But he is dead, and was as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily bewailed of the <hi>Germans</hi> as of his own Subjects, who yet profeſſed, <hi>That their loſs was unſpeakable,</hi> and in both their Chronicles ſhall his honourable memory be for ever famous, and his name ſhall live in their mouths in after Ages; Yet did not this glorious King dye, without ſome ſingular and miraculous Prodigies, which happened about that time in his own Kingdom of <hi>Sweden;</hi> Amongſt others, at the very ſame hour and time when this battle of <hi>Lutzen</hi> was fought, there appeared juſt over the Caſtle, and Royal Palace at <hi>Stockholm</hi> a Virgin or Damſel holding in one hand a burning Candle, and in the other a white hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50774:62"/>which ſhe waved about; It was likewiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and obſerved, that all the doors in the Caſtle though they were ſhut and lockt, yet they three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times opened of themſelves; At the ſame time a conſiderable River in <hi>Sweden</hi> was ſuddenly dryed up, ſo that for a whole day any one might go over it dry foot; Alſo in <hi>Smaland</hi> a Province of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Bells without the help of any man began to ring, and ſound out, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Inhabitants.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50774:63"/>terrible ſhreik, the Souldiers on the other ſide vowed not to ſtir a foot till the women were fetched over; whereupon the King finding that this ill humour was ſo generally diſperſed amongſt his men, that it was dangerous to purge it all at once, ſmiled out his anger for the preſent, permitting what he could not amend, yet this abuſe he afterward reformed by degrees: His Army won the day though they loſt their King, which occaſioned one to compoſe this brief Elegy.</p>

            <p>A little before his death being in diſcourſe with his Chaplain Dr. <hi>Fabricius,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>That he thought God would ere long take him away, becauſe the People did ſo overvalue and deify him;</hi> At his firſt coming into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> having a deſign upon <hi>Stetin,</hi> and his Army being now upon the ſhore, and his Boats ready on the River to imbark them, but the Wind having been contrary for ſeveral days before, the King obſerving it, kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down in the ſight of his Souldiers with his hands lifted up to Heaven, thus expreſſed himſelf; <hi>O thou moſt juſt God, thou certainly knoweſt that I did not at firſt undertake this Enterprize out of any raſhneſs or ambition, but for the glory of thy moſt Holy Name, and the defence of the Truth of thy Goſpel, here now therefore I call upon thee O God, and moſt humbly beſeech thee, that with the Air of thy favour, and with a proſperous wind, thou wouldſt be pleaſed to breath upon this my undertaking for Chriſt his ſake,</hi> Amen; No ſooner were his Prayers ended, but through Divine Providence the Wind turned about with ſo full a Gale, that the whole Fleet paſſing up the River <hi>Oder,</hi> in two hours time ſailed up Twenty Miles, and unexpectedly came to an Anchor within a Mile of <hi>Stetin,</hi> whereby he wonderfully defeated the Deſigns of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who intended within two dayes after to have laid ſiege to that City, had they not been thus miraculouſly prevented; When this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50774:63"/>King came firſt to the Crown, he reſolved to lay ſiege to <hi>Nottenburg</hi> Caſtle, which the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> had given his Father for ſome Aſſiſtance which he had afforded him; This Caſtle ſtood in an Iſland in the mouth of the moſt raging and ſwift River of <hi>Nerva,</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders deſpairing of taking it, and being unwilling their young King ſhould receive a Repulſe in his firſt attempts, they laboured to diſſwade him from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he continued reſolute to purſue it, and ſee how Almighty God wrought for him; The Beſieged <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were ſtricken with ſuch Thruſhes, Warts and Bliſters in their Throats and Mouths, they could neither chew their Meat, nor ſwallow it down, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they parlied and yielded up that impregnable Caſtle to him, wherein he found a whole years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Victuals, beſides abundance of Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, he had a difference with the <hi>Dantzickers,</hi> and they had prepared twenty or thirty ſtout men of War, intending with the firſt opening of the Spring, to have burnt up the Kings Navy in their Harbour; but toward the end of Winter, when this narrow <hi>Swediſh</hi> Sea was frozen a yard or two deep, this young King cauſed his Boors to cut open the Ice for ten or twelve Miles together, which done, he came ſuddenly one night with his Fleet upon the <hi>Dantzickers,</hi> and burnt, ſunk, and took moſt of their Fleet; Alſo in his Wars with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> he conquered ſo many Towns from him in <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi> that he inforced him by the mediation of King <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to make peace with him; In theſe wars with the <hi>Polanders</hi> his Army was never great, having for the moſt part not above Five Thouſand Men, and yet with them he fought ſeveral Battles, beat and wearied out two <hi>Imperial</hi> Armies, took in the great and ſtrong City of <hi>Elbing</hi> with divers others and finally obtained his end upon his Enemies, though they were able at the ſame time to have come upon him with ſuch a number of Horſe as had, according
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50774:64"/>to humane Reaſon, been ſufficient to have carryed him away, and five ſuch Armies as his was; He was ſlain in the Battel at <hi>Lutzen, Nov.</hi> 16. 1632. in the 38 year of his Age.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50774:65"/>already refuſed fair ofters, the <hi>Swedes</hi> denyed them now, and prepared all things ready for another aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, advancing toward the Breach, when at the ſame inſtant, the Proteſtant Miniſters with ſeveral Women came out of the Town, making moſt pitiful Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> General, ſignifying that it would certainly coſt them all their Lives, becauſe the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe was already undermined, and the Mine filled with Powder, and that they fearfully expected to be blown up immediately. Out of Commiſeration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to theſe poor people, another Agreement was offered to the Governour, and Liberty granted them to march out with their Swords only, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and the Proteſtants thereby ſaved.</p>
            <p n="51">LI. In 1634 <hi>June</hi> 23. another Prodigy happened at <hi>Dreſden</hi> in <hi>Saxony;</hi> About five a Clock in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sun firſt appeared white as Snow, and then ſuddenly became dark as if covered by a Miſt; It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared firſt in the form of a Crown, and then like a Feather, and then red as blood, in which poſture it continued for about half an hour, and then returned to its natural ſhape, but retained its ſanguine colour till it went down, and the Moon at her riſing retained the ſame bloody Aſpect, till ſhe was no longer ſeen in that Horriſon; About the ſame time at <hi>Berlin</hi> in the Marquiſate of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> it rained blood and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; and the next year in <hi>November,</hi> at <hi>Itz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>o</hi> a Town in <hi>Holſiein</hi> it rained thick blood, whoſe drops being uſed as Ink, repreſented true natural blood in writing; It is ſcarce credible how many bloody Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts and Encounters happened between theſe two Countreys, the ſame year, and the next following; but more eſpecially that ſore and bloody Battel at <hi>Witſtock,</hi> wherein ſeven Thouſand <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were ſlain by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> ſix whole Regiments being wholly cut off, with ſeveral great Commanders; Fifteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Priſoners, Fourteen Pieces of Ordnance, and Eight Thouſand Waggons were alſo left to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Conqueror; Of the <hi>Swedes</hi> likewiſe were a Thouſand
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50774:66"/>ſlain upon the place of Battel. In the ſame year, 1634. <hi>July</hi> 24. at <hi>Melnick</hi> where the <hi>Saxon</hi> Army quartered, there was a ſtrange Apparition in the Air, which was thus related by Eye-witneſſes; About Evening, when the Elector of <hi>Saxonys</hi> Chaplain was at Prayers, there appeared a ſign in the sky like a fiery Beam, and a while after, another in the form of a Scepter fiery red, juſt over the Houſe where he was Preaching, aſſoon as Sermon was ended, and the Chaplain had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Amen,</hi> the ſign vaniſhed out of ſight; After this the ſame Apparition was ſeen again of divers others; That year, and ſome others following, the <hi>Crabats</hi> like Vermine in a warren, ranſacked, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and pillaged what places ſoever they came to, ſparing neither Churches, Cloyſters, nor Noble mens Houſes, but robbed and diſmembred the Countrey people, raviſhed the Women, defloured the Maids, burnt the Villages and Towns, and committed all manner of miſchievous Inſolencies and Villanies.</p>
            <p n="52">LII. About this time Man and Beaſt and Fowls of the Air all ſeemed now to be at irreconcileable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and <hi>Germany</hi> was the Stage wherein they acted their Tragedies; At <hi>Heſſen</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1635. there met together two Armies of ſtrange Birds, which fought as it were in a ſet Battel; And near <hi>Straubinge</hi> upon the River of <hi>Danube</hi> multitudes of Dogs had their Rendevouz, who fought ſo furiouſly, that all the Neighbourhood were affrighted at the Prodigy; And as if they would admit of no Agreement, but ſuch as pleaſed themſelves, when the Governour of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> had ſent out againſt them four Companies of his Foot Souldiers, with Muskets, and other Arms to aſſault and ſlay them, they left their hoſtility among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and joyned together againſt the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, falling upon the Souldiers, and in deſpight of their ſhot and weapons, killed and devoured nine of them. This year 1635. A great Inundation of Water happened at <hi>Rome,</hi> and after that, a mortal ſickneſs; Five Moons were ſeen at once in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50774:66"/>
               <hi>Italy</hi> many Monſters<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were brought forth; At this time there began Diviſions in <hi>Scotland</hi> about Religion; The <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> fight at Sea; There was a great Plague at <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beat the <hi>French. J. Gadbury</hi> of Prodigies.</p>
            <p n="53">LIII: The next year ſtrange Prodigies terrifyed the hearts of the People; For while the Princes and Peers were in their jollity at the Diet at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> War, with its grim Attendants, Famine, Peſtilence, Fire and Deſtruction raged abroad in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; In 1636: <hi>December</hi> 19. the Spire of <hi>Shotten</hi> Steeple at <hi>Vienna</hi> being newly built, fell ſuddenly down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed the new built Church; This happened about the time of the Coronation of the new King of the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> And about the ſame time, a great Blazing Star appeared at <hi>Rome</hi> for ſome time, and then vaniſhed away ſuddenly over St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in that City, with a great noiſe, and divers Monuments placed in that Church fell down, and were utterly defaced; Now though it might ſeem overmuch boldneſs (ſaith my Author) to peep into the Ark of Divine Secrets, nor can we conclude any particular conſequences from the Accidental fall of this Steeple; yet doubtleſs the Comet, though cauſed by the meeting of ſecondary and natural Cauſes did very much preſage what happened about that time, and ſoon after; For within one Month, the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> 2. who had been ill at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and then removed to <hi>Vienna,</hi> gave up the Ghoſt; ſome Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies likewiſe happening in other places of the Empire, before the meeting of the Electoral Princes at <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> did much diſhearten the common people, and cauſed them to deſpair of any good ſucceſs by that Treaty; One was, that at <hi>Wells</hi> in <hi>Auſtria</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors houſe of Pleaſure where he then lodged, was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly uncovered by a violent Tempeſt; and this was accompanied by two others at <hi>Lintz,</hi> the firſt was the ſudden fall of an Arch of the Bridge made over the River <hi>Danubius,</hi> which the Emperor had no ſooner
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50774:67"/>paſſed over, but it tumbled into the River; The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was, that three carved Eagles placed upon the Houſe of a Burgeſs of <hi>Lintz,</hi> being broken down by the fury of this Tempeſt, were again raiſed up into the Air by the ſame violent blaſt, and ſhattered three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, and one of them at laſt fell upon the Houſe appointed for the Aſſembly of the Province, an other upon the Statehouſe, and the third upon a publick Conduit or Aqueduct. This happened in 1636. and gave occaſion to the diſtracted minds of men to project terrible things from that meeting of the States.</p>
            <p n="54">LIV. And this indeed was a bloody time in the Dukedom of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and there was a general fear that the fury of the War would not be confined to that Countrey, which was the more heightned by a ſtrange Prodigy, which (though it admits of no particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation) was as terrible as portentous; In the vear 1637, the Conduit at <hi>Iſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ach</hi> ſcituate in the midſt of the Market-place, inſtead of Water, ſuddenly pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out Blood and ſo continued for two hours, before the Water returned again; About which time many bloody skirmiſhes happened between the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Swediſh</hi> Forces few days paſſing without much bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and the condition of the Dukedom of <hi>Saxony</hi> was exceeding deplorable, cauſed not only by the <hi>Swedes</hi> their Enemies, but alſo by their ſeeming Friends the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who uſually burnt thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Ground, where they did not find as much Proviſion for their Souldiers as they demanded; So that the Boors and poor Countrey-men did now long for Peace, which they were then ſo much ſtrangers to, deſiring that their Swords might be turned into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their Pikes into Shepherds Crooks; the Merchant longed for an open Trade, and Perſons of all Conditions deſired an end to theſe Troubles and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, but it ſeems the miſeries of that Countrey were not yet come to the height: In the ſame year 1637, the Water at <hi>Weimar</hi> was again turned to blood;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50774:67"/>A ſtrange Worm in the ſhape of a Man, with perfect Lineaments, and a Golden Crown on his head, was found in a Sallad at an Herb-womans ſhop in <hi>Collen,</hi> which (if not Prodigious) was yet very dreadful. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man appeared in a mourning habit in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of St. <hi>Stephens,</hi> the Cathedral Church of <hi>Vienna, June</hi> 18. 1637. who with a doleful voice from eleven to twelve a Clock at night yelled out theſe terrible Words; <hi>Woe unto you; Wo unto you;</hi> Often repeating them, and no other; The Bells without any help of men, ſuddenly rung out to the great affrightment of the people who deſcanted upon theſe ſad <hi>Omens,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch horrid Conſequences would enſue as preſented themſelves to their ſeveral Fancies; And indeed not without cauſe, for after this, a new time of trouble began, the ſword raging in the moſt and beſt part of <hi>Germany;</hi> and Fire likewiſe, not only by chance, but by the Will and Choice of ſuch as uſed that devouring Element to the dammage of their Enemies, and the General Ruin of their Countrey.</p>
            <p n="55">LV. Thus have I (with my Author) run over the Prodigious Signs and Warnings of <hi>Germany,</hi> with a brief Account of the miſerable Events which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; But having met with a larger Relation of the dreadful Conſequences of theſe amazing Prodigies as they were publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Vincent</hi> a Learned <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Phyſician, who was an Eye-witneſs thereof; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Woful Calamities of that Countrey.

Of the <hi>Exactions</hi> and <hi>Extortions</hi> that have been committed. 2. The <hi>Tortures and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which have been exerciſed. 3. The <hi>Rapes</hi> and <hi>Raviſhments</hi> perpetrated. 4. The <hi>Robberies</hi> and <hi>Pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,</hi> 5. The <hi>Bloodſhed</hi> and <hi>Murders.</hi> 6. The <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>Deſtructions</hi> committed by the Popiſh Armies in thoſe Countreys: Theſe ſhall be the Scenes of this firſt Act; <hi>Famine and Peſtilence</hi> ſhall ſtand for the other Acts of this direful Tragedy; In which as no Action or Paſſion was ſimple or ſingle, ſo I cannot rehearſe them without ſometime intermixing one with the other.</p>
            <p n="56">LVI. And firſt for <hi>Extortions</hi> and <hi>Exactions;</hi> As no Province or part of <hi>Germany</hi> can boaſt of her Freedom from theſe miſeries, though ſome have been more oppreſt than others; So there is no Prince nor State which hath not ſuffered therein; nay no City, no Town, nor almoſt no Perſon whatſoever; Every weeks Relation tells us of Hundreds, Thouſands, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Rix-dollars or Gilders, impoſed, exacted, and extorted by the Conquerors or Spoylers, for the redemption of mens Lives or Liberties, Goods or Houſes; ſtrange and almoſt impoſſible to be paid have been the Ranſomes taxed upon the Burgers at the taking of ſome Towns; to which end they have threatned, impriſoned, and abuſed the Magiſtrates till they condeſcended: At <hi>Cryphenberg</hi> they kept the Senators ſhut up in the Common Hall, vexing and tormenting them ſo long with Hunger and Smoak, that ſome of them dyed. In <hi>Heidelburg</hi> Caſtle many Burgers, and Reverend Miniſters were impriſoned, and fed with Bread and Water till the Charity of the Reformed Churches could relieve them; After thoſe at <hi>Frankendale</hi> had upon neceſſity ſurrendred that Town, they could not enjoy the Articles granted them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50774:68"/>by the Enemy, but the grave Councellors and other Magiſtrates were forced to accept of ſuch Conditions as were fitter for Slaves and Dogs than men; ſome were thrown into Priſon, and ſo ſeverely uſed, that many of them dyed through grief and ſorrow; others though much impoveriſhed, were forced to redeem themſelves with unreaſonable Ranſoms; The Goods of thoſe which fled were confiſcated; and though the Inhabitants would willingly have left their Houſes and rich Furniture as plunder to thoſe bloody Villains, yet they were detained in the City, and their deſtruction was moſt cruellyplotted and deſigned; After the ſame manner they dealt with many others, as well contrary to all Oaths and Promiſes as to the Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith of all Nations.</p>
            <p n="57">LVII. But not to inſiſt on theſe, let us in the ſecond place conſider the <hi>Tortures</hi> and <hi>Torments</hi> which the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Souldiers exerciſed upon the Perſons of the Inhabitants, without the leaſt reſpect to Age, Quality, or Sex, which diſcovered them to be rather <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> than Men of Arms; For even Princes, whoſe Perſons are ſacred, though they never bore Arms, as the old Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſe</hi> and others; yea, ſome of the Female Sex, as the old Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> have without any regard or pity been impriſoned, reviled and abuſed by theſe Miſcreants: Some of <hi>Tillies</hi> Souldiers cauſed the D. of <hi>Saxonys</hi> Subjects to be tortured by half ſtrangling them, and preſſing their Thumbs with wheels, they forced others to eat their own Excrements, which if they refuſed, they thruſt down their Throats, thereby choaking ſome of them, and thoſe they ſuſpected to have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, were exquiſitely tortured to make them confeſs; yea, Princely Perſonages have ſuffered the like cruelty with meaner men. They tyed ſtrong Matches or Cords about the heads of ſome, which were twiſted, till the blood came out of their Eyes, Ears and Noſes, yea, till their Eyes ſtarted out of their heads; Others had burning Matches tyed betwixt their Fingers, to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50774:69"/>their Noſes, Tongues, Jaws, Cheeks, Breaſts, Legs, and Secrets, even thoſe parts which Nature hideth, they either filled with Powder, or tyed bags of Powder to them, and ſo giving fire to them, in an horrible manner burſt their bellies, and killed them; They pierced and raced the skin and fleſh of ſome, as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers deal with Leather; and have drawn Cords through their Thighs, Legs, Arms, Noſes, Ears and Lips; Others they hung up in the ſmoak, drying them with ſmall Fires, and for fear they ſhould dye too ſoon, they ſometime refreſhed them with ſmall drink or cold water; Some they burned or ſmothered in hot Ovens, and roſted others with ſtraw Fires, ſo that it was a great favour to be hanged or ſtrangled; they bound the hands and fee of ſome ſo hard, that the Blood ſprouted out at the end of their Fingers and Toes, and tyed the hands and feet of others backward together, ſtopping their Mouths with Clouts to hinder them from Praying: Some were hanged up with Ropes tyed to their Privy parts, and hearing their roaring, they have endeavoured to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar and drown their cryes as in ſport; yea, which is yet more deteſtable, when they found any poor Creatures troubled with Ruptures, or burſtneſs, they have inlarged them, and then filling thoſe parts with Gunpowder, have villanouſly blown them up as with a Mine: Many they truſſed up on high, hanging Stones and Weights on their Feet to ſtretch out their bodies; They have planed the Faces of others with Chiſels and other Inſtruments, pretending to make it even; ſome men they have openly gelded in the preſence of their Wives and Children: The Mouths of ſome they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gags, and then poured ſtinking water, piſs, or other naſty Liquors down their Throats, ſaying it was a <hi>Swediſh</hi> draught: whereby growing ſick, and their Bellies ſwelling like a Tun, they have dyed by leaſure with the greater Torment; They thruſt a knotted clout down the Throats of others, and pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up again with a ſtring, thereby even moving
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50774:69"/>the very Bowels out of their places, by which cruel Torments they made ſome Deaf, Dumb, and Blind, others Lame, and miſerable Cripples, if they did not kill them outright. If a Husband intreated for his Wife, or a Woman for her Husband, they then tortured the Petitioner before the others Eyes, and which ſeems almoſt incredible, when theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were dying under their mercileſs hands, and cryed to God in their pain and anguiſh, theſe helliſh Executioners would command and force them to call upon, and pray to the Devil; Infinite almoſt and unſpeakable indeed were the Cruelties exerciſed by the outragious Souldiers on all ſides; nay ſome were ſo damnably wicked as to make it their ſtudy to invent new Tortures; they took an ancient Reverend Divine, and ſtripping him, bound him upon a Table on his back, and faſtened a great ſtrong Cat upon his Belly, beating and pricking the Cat to make her fix her Teeth and Claws in the poor mans Belly; So that the Man and Cat partly through Famine, and partly through pain and anguiſh both dyed under their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors; ſome of the curſed <hi>Croats,</hi> or <hi>Crabats</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to teach their Horſes to eat the fleſh of Chriſtians, and contrived worſe Tortures than <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris, Nero, Dionyſius,</hi> or any of thoſe monſtrous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of former ages ever arrived to, ſo that we may ſay, <hi>Caucaſus</hi> bred them, Tygers fed them, and Hell taught them, the laſt of which, without deep repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was probably their eternal Lot.</p>
            <p n="58">LVIII. I have ſaid much of the former particular, though not the Tenth part of what was acted: I will now thirdly ſpeak a little of the enſuing Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Rapes and Ravi hments</hi> hardly to be imagined, and beyond all humane modeſty did they commit, Virgins, Matrons, Widows, and Wives without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction have they violated and forced even in the preſence of their Parents, Husbands and Neighbours, yea, Women with Child, and even in Childbed; No Ghappel, Church, or other place hath been free from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50774:70"/>their filthieſt pollutions, and barbariſms; The very Hoſpitals and Bedlam-houſes have not been ſpared, their Deviliſh Debaucheries have there found Subjects for their Luſts. In the Land of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> a poor lean mad woman who had been kept in chains above Twenty years, was by theſe Hell-hounds let looſe; to whom they brought divers others like her ſelf, ſome mad, others dumb, all wretched Creatures, they tyed their Coats about their ears, and then ſhamefully abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them; In <hi>Pomerania</hi> they raviſhed the handſomeſt Virgins of that Countrey, before their Parents faces, forcing their Friends to ſing Pſalms to them all the while. In <hi>Italy</hi> I have heard the Villanies of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Troops recited with Tears; Among others, a beautiful Maid was hid by her Parents in a Dunghil, but they diſcovering her, raviſhed her, and then bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly cutting her in pieces, hung her quarters up in the Church, and bid her Friends pray to the Saints for her relief: In the Land of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> two Souldiers took a Girl of ten years old, and carryed her into the Wood to raviſh her. The Mother with hands held up, came running after our Coach (ſaith my Author) crying out to my Colonel, but he being a ſtranger had no command there, and could not relieve her, ſoon after weſaw the 2 Horſemen come out of the Wood, whether they left the poor Child dead or alive I know not: Some virtuous and chaſt women they have offered to kill, or thrown their Children into the Fire to make them yield: They ſpared not the very Nuns, but after they had broke into their Cloyſters, and pillaged them of all their goods, they have likewiſe raviſhed and killed ſome of them; Some Women have leaped into Rivers and Wells; others have killed themſelves, becauſe they would not be ſubject to the luſts of theſe Helliſh Furies; nay not only ſick and weak Virgins and Women have been violated till they dyed, but theſe wretches have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted filthineſs with the dead Bodies.</p>
            <p n="59">LIX. But fourthly as to <hi>Robberies and Pillaging,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:50774:70"/>they were ſo numerous, that no man could paſs any where in <hi>Germany,</hi> but he was robbed, ſtript, and perhaps killed; The Merchants of <hi>Frankford, Norem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Leipſwick, Hamburg, &amp;c.</hi> have had too woful experience thereof; The Merchants of <hi>Baſil</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Mart of <hi>Strasburg</hi> and other Fairs, were ſet upon by the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> in their Lodgings; and though they offered to prove themſelves Merchants, and ſo ought to paſs freely, yea, though they begged their Lives upon their knees, yet they villanouſly murdered Ten of them, ſaying, <hi>They muſt dye becauſe they were Hereticks:</hi> The reſt leaving their Goods and Cloaths behind, eſcaped ſtark naked in the night by flight. Yea, the very Convoys who pretended to guard Travellers, were oft times as bad as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, watching all occaſions to cheat them of their money, goods, and Horſes, ſpoyling their Waggons when they made a ſtand, and rifling and ſtripping the meaneſt perſon if he ſtragled in the leaſt from the Company; Two Counteſſes of great Nobility, with their fair Daughters, were entertained by us (ſaith my Author) in the Caſtle of <hi>Heidelburg,</hi> and when proviſion grew ſcarce, they went away with the Enemies paſport, notwithſtanding which they were robbed and ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed in their Coaches of all they had, not leaving them the very Garments that covered them; yea they ſhamefully plundred the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, though priviledged by his Office in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo that the caſe was ſtrangely altered in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> where not long before a man might have rid with an hundred pound in his pocket, and only a whip in his hand through all thoſe Countreys without the leaſt fear of being injured; But now the very Souldiers even robbed one another if they found them in the leaſt out of their quarters; neither did they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God nor Devil, but in their curſed Oaths and Blaſphemies, nor was there any action ſo vile, but they were ready to commit it, and this introduces the next particular.</p>

If any had a Beaſt left which he carefully kept for his neceſſity, ſome or other of his Acquaintance would, if poſſible, ſteal it from him and eat it; They ſnatched from each other with great eagerneſs, the very ſtinking Carrion which had lain 5 or 6 weeks dead, and full of Maggots, yea, they fought and beat one another to get a morſel thereof, as it happened at a place called <hi>Dubach;</hi> It

            <p>And as the <hi>Famine</hi> increaſed, when no more food was to be got, men were like inraged Beaſts one againſt another, and gathering together by Troops, watched one another upon the High-ways, and ſo murthered, dreſt, and eat each other, ſo that none could paſs ſafely on the way, or in the ſtreets without a guard, or very well armed, and though ſome have been taken and ſeverely puniſhed by Juſtice, yet others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued lurking to ſeize upon Paſſingers; Three Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens at <hi>Odenheim</hi> near <hi>Worms</hi> agreed to live together and take their chance, but as the Proverb ſaith, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hath no Law, and hunger is a ſharp Thorn,</hi> for in a while they were all ſo extreamly pinched with <hi>Famine,</hi> that they ſought to take away one anothers lives to ſave their own, Two of them conſpired to kill the third by ſtrangling her in bed, or ſome other way, and after to dreſs and eat her up.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50774:74"/>to her houſe, and knocking at the door, asked her if ſhe had not ſeen his Wife, ſhe anſwered him, no; But ſuch deeds of cruelty are hard to be concealed, <hi>Murder will out,</hi> as they ſay; The man goes into her houſe, and caſting his eyes round, looks into every corner, at length he ſpies an hand to ſtick out of the Pot which hung over the Fire; Hereupon being overcome with grief, he rageth againſt the Murdereſs, and threatens her ſo ſeverely, that ſhe preſently confeſſeth the whole truth to him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he complains to a Juſtice, the woman is ſeized and brought before the Lords of Juſtice ſitting in the Judgment Seat; They deliberate a great while about her puniſhment, ſome were of opinion that what ſhe had acted was not as a Rational Creature, but as a Brute. ſince the deſire of Food is common to us with Beaſts. But others alledged ſuch horrid wickedneſs ought ſeverely to be puniſhed for a Terror to others; Upon which ſhe was led to the common place of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, her head was cut off, and her body being bound to a wheel, was left as a ſpectacle to all Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the horror of the Fact.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50774:76"/>a knife, and afterward dreſſed and eat it; When it began to be known, ſhe was examined before the Judges, who asked her <hi>Why ſhe killed her Child,</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>That mighty and intolerable hunger had forced her to do it, and that it was the fruit of her own body, which ſhe thought ſhe might better make uſe of, than of any other;</hi> However ſhe was condemned to dye, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed for a terror to others.</p>
            <p>I am even weary (ſaith he) of theſe lamentable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, yet more miſerable Accidents, if more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable can be, followed theſe; They traced and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the dead bodies to their place of Burial, and then digging them out of their Graves, dreſſed and eat them; ſo that in divers places, at <hi>Worms</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, they were forced to ſet watch at the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and over the Graves to keep the dead from being ſtolen and eaten; Yea to that extremity were they brought that ſome conſtrained by hunger, took Poyſon to diſpatch themſelves, nay the very Wild Beaſts in Woods were ſtarved for want of Prey; The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> travelling to <hi>Frankford</hi> in his way toward <hi>England,</hi> a Boor or Peaſant of the Countrey being their Guide, and having his Legs bare, a Fox purſued him even amidſt the Earls Servants, and would not forbear biting of his Legs and heels for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hunger, till they gave him a blow on the neck, and ſo took him alive; The eyes of the Fox were ſunk in his head, his bones ſtuck out, and he was ſo extream lean, that his ribs almoſt clung toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they carryed him alive with them in the Coach, and after a few days he dyed; Another <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentleman who came about that time through <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> by the by-ways thereby to eſcape the Souldiers, reported that Wolves, Foxes, and other Wild Beaſts lay dead for want of Food, and that in ſome Places men lived only upon Robbery, and the ſpoil of Strangers, or of one another, ſo that Thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was the only Trade then practiced among them.</p>

And here I cannot omit what I find rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Hiſtory of <hi>Ceilon</hi> an Iſland in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> publiſhed by Captain <hi>Robert Knox,</hi> who was a Captive there for near Twenty years; It happened, ſaith he that in <hi>December</hi> 1664. there was a dangerous Rebellion in this Countrey againſt their King, about which time there appeared a fearful Blazing Star; Juſt at the inſtant of this Riſing the Star was right over our heads, and one thing I very much wondred at, that whereas before this Inſurrection the Tail ſtood away toward the Weſt, from whence this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion ſprung, yet the very night after, for I well obſerved it, the Tail was turned and ſtood away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Eaſt, and by degrees it diminiſhed quite away; At this time I ſay, the People of this Land having been long and ſore oppreſſed by this Kings unreaſonable and cruel Government, contrived a Plot againſt him: He uſed to ſhed a great deal of blood without the leaſt Reaſon, his Cruelty appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in the Tortures and painful deaths which he inflicted, and in the extents of his puniſhments in deſtroying whole Families for the miſcarriage of one Perſon; For when he is diſpleaſed with any, he does not always command to kill them outright, but firſt to torment them, which is done by cutting and pulling away their fleſh with Pincers, burning them with hot Irons clapt to them to make them confeſs their Confederates, whereby they many times confeſs more than they ever ſaw or knew to be rid of their Torments; After Confeſſion he ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to hang their two hands about their necks, and to make them eat their own fleſh, and Mothers to eat their own Children, and ſo to lead them through the City in publick view to terrifie all, to the place of Execution, the Dogs following to eat them; who are ſo accuſtomed to it, that ſeeing a Priſoner led away, they follow after; At the place of Execution, there are ſome always ſticking upon Poles, others hanging up in Quarters upon Trees, beſides what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50774:89"/>lye killed by Elephants on the ground, or by other ways; His wrath is not appeaſed (as aforementioned) by the Execution of the Malefactor, but oft times he puniſheth all his Generation, it may be he kills them altogether, or gives them all away for Slaves; ſo far is he from regarding the good of his Countrey, that he rather endeavours the deſtruction thereof, for being now between ſeventy and eighty years old, therefore Nature tells him he muſt leave it; However there is no love loſt between the King and his People, which occaſioned them to enter into the aforeſaid Conſpiracy againſt him; The Deſign was to aſſault the Kings Court in the night, and to ſlay him, and make the Prince his Son King, He being then about 15 years of Age, and was with his Mother the Queen in the City of <hi>Cande;</hi> The time appointed to Act it was <hi>Decemb.</hi> 20. 1664, at twelve a Clock at night, and having got about two hundred men, (not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more.) ſince they had ſo many Confederates at Court, in the dead of the night, they came march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the City of <hi>Nillemby</hi> where the King then was, The Captain of the Watch was thought to be of their Party, but if he were not, it was not in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to reſiſt them, however he was afterward exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for it, Being entred the City, they haſtened down to the Court, and fell upon the Great men who lay then without the Palace, upon the Guard; Many who were not intruſted with the Deſign were killed, and thoſe that could make their eſcape, got in unto the King, who was ſecured only with a Clay wall thatched, which was all his ſtrength; yet theſe People were afraid to aſſault his Perſon, lying ſtill till the morning; At which time the King made his eſcape unto the Mountains with only Fifty Perſons, There were ſome Horſes went with him, but the ways were ſo bad, that he could not ride; They were fain to drive an Elephant before him to break the way through the Woods, that the King with his Followers might paſs. As he fled, the Conſpirators
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50774:89"/>purſued him, but at a great diſtadce for fear of ſome exceellent Fowling Pieces which he had with him, and ſo he got ſafe to the Mountain <hi>Gauluda</hi> about 15 miles off, where many of the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about reſorted to him; But if the Rebel Party had been reſolute, who were the greater number, even almoſt all the Kingdom, this Hill could not have ſecured him, but they might have driven him from thence, there being many ways by which they might have aſcended.</p>
            <p>The People having thus driven away, the old King marched away to the City of <hi>Cande,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Prince to be King, telling us <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that what they had done was not raſhly, but upon good Conſideration and advice, the King by his evil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment having occaſioned it, who went about to deſtroy both them and their Countrey; As in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Ambaſſadors; hindering of all Trade, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priſoners of all people that come upon his Land, and killing his Subjects and their Children, not ſuffering them to enjoy, nor to ſee their Wives; And that all this was contrary to reaſon, and as they were informed to the Government of other Countreys; The Prince being young and tender, and having never been out of the Pallace, nor ever ſeen any but thoſe that attended on his Perſon, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finghted to ſee ſo many coming, and bowing down to him, and telling him that he was <hi>King,</hi> and his Father was fled into the Mountains; neither did he ſay or act any thing, as not owning the buſineſs, or elſe not knowing what to ſay or do; This much diſcouraged the Rebels, to ſee they had no Thanks for their pains, and ſo all things ſtood till, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>pice it is, exceeding formidable with flames and fumes from the very bottom and ſides of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with an horrendous roaring and bellowing not unlike the burſting forth of Thunders, ſo that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imagination and thoughts of the Fire and Ruins ſo nigh at hand, cannot but at firſt ſight amaze, and afright any humane Creature, and make him ſtart from it, as from the Infernal Gulph of Hell; On one ſide within are moſt dark and dreadful Dens, one whereof is ſo vaſt, as to be capable to contain Thirty Thouſand Men; In many places you may ſee the tracts and paths of huge Torrents of melted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; In the very top, Snows and Aſhes, or Cinders, as if they had concluded an Eternal Wedlock, are ſeen to overwhelm all things with a ſad and doleful countenance, which are very dangerous to unwary Viſitors, becauſe under them there lye concealed deep holes, and devouring Gulphs, without bottom or end, which have ſwallowed up very many, coming unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly too near without a Guide, and by their ruine have left warnings to others not raſhly to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe hidden deceits which have cheated mortals of their Lives; In the utmoſt bottom of this Helliſh Gulf the Fire is at no time extinguiſhed, but always ſends forth either boyling heat, ſmoak or flame, yet outwardly it begins to grow fierce and terrible only at certain intervalls of time more or leſs according to the Combuſtible matter heaped together; and by how
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50774:92"/>much longer it hath ceaſed, by ſo much it burſts forth with greater violence, and together with the Flame, ſends forth huge heaps of Sands, and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Stones of wondrous weight.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fires have broke forth in ſeveral Ages of the World, to the great terror and deſtruction of the Inhabitants, and all the adjacent Countreys; As in the year of the world 2600 when the Poſterity of <hi>Janus</hi> went to ſeek new Colonies, they firſt entred <hi>Sicily,</hi> where at that time there was ſo great a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mountain, that the new Planters leaving the Iſland for fear of Deſolation, went to ſeek new habitations in <hi>Italy;</hi> after them followed the <hi>Sicane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were likewiſe driven away from theſe Eaſtern Parts, to the Weſtern by theſe dreadful <hi>Aetnean</hi> burnings. In the year of the world 3180, and for above four hundred years after, this Mountain was all on fire with three huge burnings; A little after the Mountain raging anew, it is ſaid to have drawn <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> himſelf into the higheſt admiration; Alſo in the Reign of <hi>Hero,</hi> at which time Hiſtories deliver that <hi>Empedocles</hi> an Obſerver of the Mountain was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. In the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> about fifty years before Chriſt, <hi>Diodorus</hi> relates, That <hi>Aetna</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged moſt violently, which they ſaid portended the Death of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> It is reported to have been ſo great, that the Sea with its fervour and boyling heat burnt even the very Ships, even as far as the <hi>Vulcanello</hi>'s, All the Fiſh being deſtroyed and boyled to death; yea within twenty years, the Mountain burnt four times. In the Reign of <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> forty nine years after Chriſt, the Mountain raged ſo, that the Emperor at that time in <hi>Sicily</hi> was ſo affrighted, that he betook himſelf to ſafer ſtations; yet they relate, that the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> out of the greatneſs of his mind did aſcend the Mountain very far to conſider more nearly ſuch great Miracles; In ſeveral Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it made woful irruptions, as from the year 1160, to 1169, all <hi>Sicily</hi> was ſhaken with huge Earthquakes,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50774:93"/>and the Mountain <hi>Aetna</hi> foaming mightily, overthrew all the circumjacent places with incredible Deſolation, with the ruine of the Cathedral Church of <hi>Catania</hi> about ten miles diſtant, in which Abbot <hi>John</hi> and his Monks were overwhelmed; Many other fearful burnings have happened ſince that time, but none more horrible for its mighty devaſtations than that in the year 1669, The Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> His Majeſties late Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> in his return from thence, viſiting <hi>Catania,</hi> was an Eye-witneſs of this Prodigious Judgment, whereof he gave the following Account to His preſent Majeſty, King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, as ſoon as he came to <hi>Naples.</hi>

               <hi>In my Voyage from</hi> Malta <hi>to this place, I touched at the City of</hi> Catania <hi>in</hi> Sicily, <hi>and was there moſt kindly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the Biſhop to lodge in his Palace, which I accepted, that ſo I might be the better able to inform your Majeſty of that extraordinary Fire which comes from Mount</hi> Gibel, 15 <hi>miles diſtant from that City; which for its horridneſs in the aſpect, for the vaſt quantity thereof, (for it is</hi> 15 <hi>miles in length, and</hi> 7 <hi>in breadth) for its monſtrous devaſtation and quick progreſs, may be termed an Inundation of Fire, a Flood of Fire, Cinders and burning Stones, burning with that Rage as to advance into the Sea</hi> 600 <hi>yards, and that to a mile in breadth, which I ſaw; and that which did augment my admiration was, to ſee in the Sea this matter like ragged Rocks, burning in ſour fathom water, two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom higher than the Sea it ſelf; ſome parts liquid and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and throwing off, not without great violence, the ſtones about it, which like a cruſt of a vaſt bigneſs, and red hot, ſell into the Sea every moment, in ſome place or other, cauſing a great and horrible noiſe, ſmoak and hiſſing in the Sea; and thus more and more coming after it, making a firm foundation in the Sea it ſelf. I ſtayed there from nine a Clock on Saturday morning, to ſeven next morning, and this Mountain of Fire and Stones, with Cinders, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the Sea</hi> 20 <hi>yards at leaſt, in ſeveral places; in the middle of this Fire, which burn'd in the Sea, it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50774:93"/>hath formed a paſſage like to a River, with its Banks on each ſide very ſteep and craggy, and in this Channel moves the greateſt quantity of this Fire, which is the moſt liquid, with ſtones of the ſame compoſition, and Cinders all red hot, ſwimming upon the Fire of a great magnitude;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From this River of Fire (under the great Maſſe of the Stones which are generally three fathom high all over the Country, where it burns and in other places much more,) there are ſecret Conduits or Rivulets of this liquid matter, which Communicate Fire and heat into all parts more or leſs, and melts the Stones and Cinders by fits in thoſe places where it toucheth them, over and over again; where it meets with Rocks or Houſes of the ſame matter (as many are) they melt and go away, with the Fire; where they find other compoſitions they turn them to lime or aſhes, (as I am informed,) The compoſition of this Fire, Stones and Cinders, are Sulphur, Nitre, Quick-ſilver, Sal-Armoniac, Lead, Iron, Braſs, and all other Mettals. It moves not regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor conſtantly down hill; in ſome places it hath made the Valleys Hills, and the Hills that were not high are now Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys. When it was night I weat upon two Towers in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, and could plainly ſee at</hi> 10 <hi>miles diſtance, as we judged, the Fire to begin to run from the Mountain in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line, the flame to aſcend as high and as big as one of the higheſt and greateſt Steeples in Your Majeſties Kingdoms, and to throw up great Stones into the Air; I could diſcern the River of Fire to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I aſſure Your Majeſty, no Pen can expreſs how
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50774:94"/>terrible it is, nor can all the Art and Induſtry of the world quench, or divert that which is burning in the Country.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50774:94"/>to us) ſtruck no ſmall terror into the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, all Objects appearing alſo of the ſame colour, with a paleneſs received from that of the Sun: The ſame night happened in this City as well as the whole Country hereabouts, a terrible and unuſual Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, whoſe ſtrong and unequal motions joyned with horrible Roarings from <hi>Monte Gibello</hi> exceedingly frighted the Inhabitants, but was ſo extraordinarily violent in the Country adjacent, that the People were forced to abandon their houſes, and to fly into the Fields to avoid the danger threatned them from the falling of their houſes. The Village of <hi>Nicoloſi</hi> was of all others the moſt dreadfully handled by this furious Earthquake, the houſes and other buildings being ſhaken all in pieces, and buried in their own ruines; the poor people (who had preſerved their lives by a timely flight, with ſuch little of their goods as their haſty fears would permit them to carry out with them) continued a night or two in the Fields beholding with grief and aſtoniſhment the ruine of their habitations: but obſerving that by theſe violent concuſſions, the Earth began to open in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to threaten them with inevitable ruine, they fled, though with much trouble and amazement to this City. Theſe ſhakings of the Earth being ſo frequent and violent, that the people went reeling and ſtaggering, with much difficulty ſupporting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from falling, inſomuch as what with their want of ſleep, the pains they were forced to take in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, and the great terrors imprinted on them by what they had ſeen and ſuffered, they appeared at their arrival in this City as ſo many diſtracted people wholly inſenſible of what they did.</p>
            <p>This dreadful convulſion of the Earth was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followed on Monday <hi>March</hi> 11. about 10 at night by 3 terrible Eruptions, much about the ſame time, and a little diſtance one from the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſaid Eruptions were obſerved to be on the ſide of <hi>Monte Gibello,</hi> about 2 miles beyond the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50774:95"/>called <hi>Montpileri,</hi> from whence with a terrible noiſe it threw up its flames with much fury and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence about a hundred yards in height, its noiſe not roaring only inwards from the belly of the Mountain as before, but violently cracking like peals of Ordnance or thunder, from the ſide of it, throwing out vaſt ſtones, ſome of them of 300 pound weight, which being (as it were) ſhot through the air, fell ſeveral miles diſtant from the place, whilſt the whole Air was filled with ſmoak, burning cinders, and aſhes, which fell like a fiery rain upon the Country. In the mean time iſſued from the ſide of this Prodigious Mountain a vaſt Torrent of Melted and burning Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which like an Inundation, Drowned, as in a Flood of Fire, the Countrey on this ſide of it. This Burning River ran down upon the Mountain <hi>Montpileri,</hi> which, oppoſing its direct courſe, it divided it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Streams, which encompaſſed the ſaid Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; one of them taking its way by <hi>La Guardia,</hi> the <hi>Convent</hi> of St. <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lpaſſo,</hi> the other by the Towns of <hi>Monpileri,</hi> and <hi>Falicchi,</hi> which in few hours were wholly deſtroyed and loſt, not ſo much as any ſign of them remaining, with ſeveral leſſer Villages and Farmes, and with them the Famous <hi>Image</hi> of the bleſſed Lady of the <hi>Annunciata;</hi> which, though high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reverenced throughout the whole <hi>Iſland,</hi> eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Wonder of <hi>Sicily</hi> and the whole World, and to which the People with much Devotion reſorted in Pilgrimage from the remoteſt parts, was alſo ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up and conſumed by this dreadful Torrent.</p>
            <p>This Fiery and burning Deluge immediately ſpread it ſelf to above ſix mile in breadth, ſeeming to be ſomewhat of the colour of melted and burning Glaſs; but, as it cooles, becomes hard and Rocky, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in its paſſage leaves Hills and Pyramids of that matter behind it.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Monte Gibello</hi> from its top raged with dreadful Flames, which with its noiſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions of the Earth which ſtill continued, added
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50774:95"/>not a little to the Terror of the People, who ran with Cries and Lamentations about the City and Country, expecting nothing but to be ſwallowed up or conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Fire, having no other apprehenſions but of Death, and a General Conflagration. The two Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Fire came forward, deſtroying all things in their way, and by Wedneſday, <hi>March</hi> 13th, had on the Weſt-ſide branched it ſelf into ſeveral Streams, and overran <hi>Campo Rotundo,</hi> St. <hi>Pietro,</hi> and <hi>Moſtorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anco,</hi> with <hi>La Potielli,</hi> and St. <hi>Antonino;</hi> and on the Eaſt-part ruin'd the lower part of <hi>Maſcalucia,</hi> and <hi>Le Placchi,</hi> taking its way towards this City.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 14th, the Wind came Eaſtwards, on which fell abundance of Rain, which abated not the Progreſs of the Fire; which on the Eaſt-ſide had from <hi>Maſcalucia</hi> made its way to St. <hi>Giovanni di Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo,</hi> the lower part whereof it deſtroyed; and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on, ſeemed to threaten this City on one ſide, as did that on the Weſt-ſide the other. As the Fire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, the Religious every where appeared with much Devotion, carrying in Proceſſion their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, eſpecially thoſe of St. <hi>Agatha,</hi> the famous Martyr of <hi>Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nia,</hi> in which they repoſed no ſmall confidence, followed by great multitudes of People, ſome of them mortifying themſelves with Whips, and other ſigns of Penance, with great Complaints and Cryes, expreſſing their dreadful expectation of the Events of thoſe Prodigious fiery Inundations.</p>
            <p>Whil'ſt the People were thus buſied in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and aſtoniſht by their Fears, News was brought to the Magiſtrates of the City, that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of Thieves and Robbers had taken the opportunity of this general Diſtraction, to make a Prey of the already diſtreſſed People, and that they had murdered ſeveral of them for their Goods; and that it was to be fear'd, that the City of <hi>Catania</hi> it ſelf, might run ſome danger from the great numbers of them which were about the Country, and from thence took their opportunities to get into the Town.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50774:96"/>Whereupon, conſultation being had for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of farther miſchief from them, the Commander of the Caſtle was ordered with a conſiderable number of Horſe, and a Party of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to ſecure the Country and City againſt theſe Robbers; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent out ſeveral Parties with his Provoſt-Marſhal, with Order to ſeize on all ſuſpected Perſons, and ſuch as were not able to give a good account of themſelves: and, for ſuch as were taken in the Fact Robbing, to Execute them by Martial-Law, without any farther Tryal; and accordingly cauſed three pair of Gallowes to be ſet up for their ſpeedy Execution; one before the Gate <hi>Di Aci,</hi> a ſecond in the <hi>Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,</hi> and a third before the Gate <hi>Della Decima,</hi> ſetting ſtrong Guards upon the Gates of the City, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all ſuſpected Houſes to be ſearched, an Account to be given in of all Lodgers, and ſuch Perſons to be ſecured, as could any ways fall under a Suſpition. The poor People out of the Country being by this Prodigious Calamity ſtript out of all their Eſtates, and reduced to great extrem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty, fled moſt of them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and relief to this City, with great Lamentations, moving the Charity of the Magiſtrates, whho were readily inclined to give them the beſt aſſiſtance they were able; and the Citizens, moved by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Sufferings, freely open'd their Doores, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Houſes with as many of thoſe diſtreſſed People as they could poſſibly receive; the Biſhop, and all perſons of Quality and Eſtate, contributing largely for their ſupport, till better Order could be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the diſpoſing of them.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Meſſina</hi> alſo, and ſeveral other Cities (informed of this extraordinary Calamity) ſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large Supplies of Proviſions, offering their beſt aſſiſtance to this place, in caſe of extremity. All the Elements ſeemed at this time to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and to conſpire together for the puniſhment of the Inhabitants; The Air was continually darkened with Clouds and Smoke, agitated by great and violent
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50774:96"/>Winds, and oftentimes ſhowred down great Rains, inſomuch as the Sun from the beginning of theſe Eruptions, very ſeldom appeared to us, and when it did, (with extraordinary paleneſs,) for a little time only, and (as it were, abhorring ſo dreadful a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) ſoon hid its face again under a thick Cloud.</p>
            <p>The Sea ran much higher than it was wont to do, and by its extraordinary Roaring, and in ſome places over-flowing its Banks, added not a little to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. The Land every where infeſted with Thieves, inſomuch, that till by the extraordinary care taken by the Magiſtrates and Officers ſevere exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was done upon ſuch as were apprehended in the Fact, no perſon was able to ſtir abroad without danger of his life; whilſt the Fire by this prodigious overflowing of the Mountain, threatned to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 15th. the ſtream of fiery Matter which deſtroyed the lower part of St. <hi>Giovanni di Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo</hi> divided it ſelf into two parts, one of its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches taking its way toward <hi>Moſterbianco,</hi> the other threatning the City of <hi>Catania,</hi> but this laſt was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to move with more ſlowneſs than before, having in 24 hours time ſcarcely gained 20 paces.</p>
            <p>On the 18th being Monday, the Torrents being ſtill ſeen to draw nearer and nearer to this City, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with Monſegnior <hi>Cambuchi</hi> the Biſhop of this place, followed by all the Clergy Secular and Regular, and an infinite number of people went in a ſolemn Proceſſion out of this City to <hi>Monte de St. Sofia,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying out with greateſt Devotion their choiceſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and upon an Altar erected in view of the Mountain, expoſed them, where they celebrated Maſs and uſed the Exorciſmes accuſtomed upon ſuch extraordinary occaſions, all which time, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ceaſed not as before with exceſſive roaring to throw up its ſmoak and flames with extraordinary violence, and abundance of great ſtones, which were carried through the Air, ſome of them falling within
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50774:97"/>their view, though at ten miles diſtance from the Eruption; the Aſhes which proceeded from thence were ſcattered in great abundance, as well on this City as on the Country adjacent, every where in the Fields with Cinders, and the heat of the ſaid Aſhes deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Graſs, which obliged the people to drive away their Cattle to a farther diſtance, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have periſhed for want of food.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſtreams of ruine dayly crept nearer and nearer to this City, but by uneven and irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according as it was more or leſs ſupplyed from its fountain; but on Wedneſday the 20th. we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that that branch of it which ſeemed moſt to threaten this City from St. <hi>Giovanni di Galermo</hi> was wholly extinguiſht, and the other which bent its courſe toward <hi>Moſter-bianco</hi> ran but ſlowly, and gave us ſome hopes that its fury was alſo near ſpent, but the other Torrent which had before overflown <hi>Moſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianco,</hi> continued its motion with as much violence as ever, being in breadth above a Muſquet ſhot over; but in probability could not eaſily overflow to the Weſtwards which was defended by its Rocky ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; another branch which ran by <hi>Santo Pietro</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be much larger than the reſt, and its ſtream more quick and active, but meeting with ſome oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in its way, it made ſome ſtop, only ſending out a Rivulet toward the Eaſtwards about three or four yards wide, of its moſt ſubtle and active matter, which directed its courſe towards a ſmall Village about a Furlong diſtant from its main ſtream; another Branch threatned <hi>Campo Rotundo,</hi> but bent its courſe weſtwards towards the Farm of <hi>Valcorrente,</hi> where its Fiery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſcattered into ſeveral deep and rocky places, without any conſiderable damage.</p>
            <p>About this time we had hopes that the violence of this eruption had been over, the Mountain not throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out its flames with that violence as before, and its noiſe and roaring in a great meaſure ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who at neareſt diſtance took a view of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50774:97"/>Mountain, informed that the top of it, was fallen in, and the Mountain ſuppoſed to want near a mile of its former height; that the largeſt of the Mouths from whence theſe fiery ſtreams were vented, was about half a mile in compaſs, but the view of this dreadful Inundation carried ſo much terror in it as they were not able to expreſs; from all theſe Mouths were vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Rivers of a thick and fiery ſubſtance of ſtone and metals melted, whoſe depth was various accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeveral places it filled in its paſſage, in ſome places 4, in others 8, 12 or 15 yards and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; its breadth in ſome places 6 miles, in others much more; itsflame like that of Brimſtone, and its motion like that of Quick-ſilver; advancing ordinarily very ſlowly, unleſs where it was provoked by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a freſh Torrent or ſome conſiderable deſcent. Whereſoever it paſſed, it left large heaps of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed matter, with which it covered and burnt the Earth, melting the Walls of Caſtles and Houſes, throwing down and conſuming all before it, nothing being yet found able to reſiſt its force, nor any thing able to quench its burning, water being obſerved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to add to its fury; whereſoever it has paſſed, it has left its dreadful marks behind it, levelling ſome hills and raiſing others, ſo much changing the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that not the leaſt trace of any place or Town remains, nothing being to be ſeen but confuſed heaps of ragged ſtone, which yielding a noiſome fume, ſtrikes terror and aſtoniſhment into all that behold it.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 22, the Mountain again roared with much loudneſs, and threw up from its Mouths a vaſt quantity of matter, which formed two large hills higher and larger than that of <hi>Monpileri,</hi> with a large bank of the ſame matter to the Eaſtward, ſending down a violent ſtream of its liquid matter towards <hi>Malpaſſo,</hi> much enlarging the former Current, and paſſing thence to <hi>Campo Rotundo</hi> and <hi>Santo Pietro</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the ruines of thoſe Towns, driving furiouflyi towards <hi>Moſter bianco;</hi> the other ſtream by <hi>Santo Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50774:98"/>de Galermo</hi> being wholly diverted and extinguiſht. From this time till the 25th, the Mountain continued ſilent, but then it burſt out again with more force than ever before, its noiſe much louder, like Peales of Ordnance, and ſo forcible and laſting, as for 24 hours it cauſed a ſhaking and trembling in our Buildings, the Air ſo filled with Smoak and Aſhes, as darkned the Face of the Sky. The Birds and Fowl about this time, either through want of Food, or illneſs of Air, which was corrupted with the noiſome ſmells ariſing from theſe Burnings, were obſerved to lye dead in all places.</p>
            <p>On the 28th. the Grand Current was advanced near the City as far as the old <hi>Capucins.</hi> which ſtruck ſo great a Terror into the People, that moſt of them left the City, only ſome Officers remaining with ſuch perſons as were under their command, who have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſent away the <hi>Magazine</hi> and all the Artillery from the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>A Latter Relation from <hi>Catania,</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 27. gives this further Account, The dreadful Inundation from <hi>Monte Gibello</hi> having deſtroyed many <hi>Caſtles</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> with an infinite loſs, and utter ruine to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, arrived lately with a renewed Force at <hi>Moſtor-bianco,</hi> which it has wholly ruin'd, from thence paſſing on to <hi>Albanelli,</hi> in four days ſpace deſtroyed all the Gardens and Vineyards with 63 Thouſand Vines. On <hi>Wedneſday April</hi> 16. With an Impetuous Fiery Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it came towards <hi>Sardanello,</hi> where all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Inhabitants of this City were Spectators of it, which reſembled a River of melted and burning Braſs, about ten Ells wide, running with ſwiftneſs to the Arch of <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> a famous Piece of Antiquity, and paſſing under it, ruin'd about 6 Ells of it, which was the breadth of the Current in that place: from thence it ran to <hi>Madonna di Monferrato,</hi> which it wholly deſtroyed: then falling down to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna delle Gratie,</hi> it entred in at one Gate, and paſſed through another, without any conſiderable hurt, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50774:98"/>running through the Gate <hi>Della Decima,</hi> filled all the Plain <hi>Di Schiara Viva,</hi> where it was above ſix Ells deep. Then taking its way towards the Bulwark, on the Sea-ſide, under the Caſtle of this City, it ran by, two Ells deep into the Sea; in which, (to the great wonder of all that ſaw it) it has made its Progreſs a mile in length, and as much in breadth, and is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Gate of the Channel, which gives us great Apprehenſions, leaſt it may that way Invade the City it ſelf: Nor is there leſs danger on the ſide <hi>Del Tindaro,</hi> where there runs a great Torrent of the ſame Active matter, which draws near, and ſeems to threaten the Walls, and is in that place about a mile in breadth, having overflowed and deſtroyed all the Gardens, from the Gate <hi>Della Decima,</hi> as far as <hi>Medonna delli Amellati.</hi>

It was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called <hi>Strongile,</hi> but by corruption <hi>Strombolo</hi> from the roundneſs thereof, for it ſeems like an high round Mountain in the Sea, out of the top whereo iſſueth continually a flame like a burning Beacon, and exceeding clear, ſo that by night eſpecially it is to be diſcerned a wonderful way, A place ſo full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the neighbouring Iſlanders, that the more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Papiſts</hi> are made to believe it is the very Jaws of Hell it ſelf; The aforenamed <hi>Kircher</hi> made Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Mountain likewiſe, which he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; That on a certain day viewing <hi>Strombolo</hi> very curiouſly, about threeſcore miles diſtant, he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be more than ordinarily furious, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared wholly overwhelmed with Fire in ſo great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it ſeemed to belch out flaming Mountains, a moſt horrendous Spectacle; And then, ſaith he, I heard a ſtrange kind of dull murmur from the Mountain ſo far off, which ſeemed to come towards us under the Earth, till it reached the ſubterraneous place where we ſtood, and there uttered ſuch horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thundrings within the Earth, with ſuch formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earthquakes, that none of them were able to ſtand on their Feet; After the violence was over, getting up again with unſpeakable Conſternation, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the deſtruction and lamentable ſubverſion of the famous Town of St. <hi>Euphemia</hi> three miles off, which happened at that inſtant, the City being wholly ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, for ſeeking for the Town, they found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, what is wonderful to be related, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a dark ſtinking Lake ſprung up in its place, they could find no men nor Inhabitants; Thence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on their Journey, they found nothing elſe for Two Hundred miles, but the Carcaſes of Cities, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid

            <p n="81">LXXXI. In <hi>April</hi> 1669, The Mountain <hi>Veſuvius</hi> aforementioned caſt up more ſmoak and Aſhes than formerly, and for ſeveral Nights the neighbouring places were much affrighted with the great Flames which iſſued from it, accompanied with unuſual noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; At the ſame time they write, That the Vice Roy of <hi>Sicily</hi> having compaſſion upon the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of above Thirty Thouſand poor People, who by their Flight had ſaved themſelves from the Fire of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> aforementioned, which had deſtroyed 17 or 18 Towns or Villages, and by the dayly approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the City of <hi>Catania,</hi> ſeemed to threaten it with inevitable ruine, ſo that the Inhabitants were leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place; And that he thereupon ſent one of his Officers to take order for the maintenance of thoſe diſtreſſed Creatures, and diſpoſing of them into places of ſafety; In the ſame Month 1669 in the night, there was a cry made in the Town of <hi>Lichfeild</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> and the Bells rang out, which frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many; This was occaſioned (ſaith Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>) by the ſight of a ſheet of Fire, which hung over that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the ſpace of half an hour, and then diſappea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>This</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I had from one that lay in the Town that night;</hi> Upon <hi>July</hi> 10. the ſame year at <hi>Weymouth</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> between ſix and nine a Clock in the morning, the Sea was obſerved to ebb and flow 7 times, of which the greater notice was taken, becauſe the weather at that time was fair and calm, and the Tydes very low, the like accident having never been obſerved there but once before about three years ſince; Upon <hi>June</hi> 20. this year at <hi>Jnſpurg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> a little after noon, there was a very violent Tempeſt with extraordinary hail, rain, Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, accompanied with an Earthquake, which had ſuch terrible Effects at <hi>Schnatz</hi> a Town about 3 miles diſtant from <hi>Jnſpurg,</hi> where the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi>

In 1678, an horrid <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot was diſcovered againſt His Majeſties Perſon and Government, and ſoon after, Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> (who took the firſt Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> upon the Diſcovery thereof,) was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Papiſts, for which three of them were executed. Several <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords were committed to the Tower, and <hi>December</hi> 1679, the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was beheaded at <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> for High Treaſon, In 1680, <hi>May</hi> 18. about 2 a Clock in the morning there began a furious ſtorm of Thunder and Lightning in <hi>London,</hi> ſo extream, that the Heavens ſeemed to be in a flame, which was accompanied with very large Hail, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary violent and haſty Showrs of rain, which continued for ſeveral hours, but about 10 a Clock in the morning a ſtrange and unuſual darkneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50774:100"/>the face of Heaven, and immediately after there fell ſuch a terrible ſtorm of Hail, as the like was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> before the ſtorm, a great murmuring or ratling noiſe was heard in the Air, the Hailſtones were ſo very large, that ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meaſured, were found to be four Inches, others five, others ſix in compaſs, nay it was confidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that ſome were ſeven, eight, and nine Inches about; it continued not above a quarter of an hour, otherwiſe it might have done much more damage than it did, yet abundance of Glaſs-Windows were ſhatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to pieces, eſpecially of thoſe called <hi>Sky-Lights,</hi> The ſtones were of different Shapes and Sizes, and the Fancies of People likened them to ſeveral things, they fell with ſuch violence, that they cut the Faces of ſome, and the heads and hands of others, who were abroad, ſome others ran into the ground in the Fields above an Inch, and being taken out, were found to be as big as Pullets Eggs, and ſome larger, ſeveral of them were round, others ſquare and flat, with very ſharp Edges.</p>
            <p n="83">LXXXIII. Not long before this, in the ſame year 1680, there fell a mighty tempeſt of Rain, Hail, Lightning and Thunder at a Town in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> It began about eleven a Clock in the morning, the Sky being for a conſiderable time black and dark, when on a ſudden there happened a great ſtorm of Hail which by the aſſiſtance of an Eaſt-wind fell with ſuch violence, that the Hail-ſtones rebounded 3 Foot high from the ground; after which followed a fierce ſhowr of Rain, which ſeemed rather to come down in pail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, than in the common way; and ſo affrighted the Inhabitants that they ran immediately into the Fields to ſave their Sheep, Lambs, and other ſmall Cattel, but had much ado to return with their Lives; during this dreadful ſtorm, the Heavens ſent forth ſuch huge and frequent flaſhes of Fire, that notwithſtanding that deluge of water, which at that inſtant fell from the Skyes, the Lightning took hold of ſome Houſes, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50774:101"/>was happily quenched without any conſiderable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, yet ſeveral Barns were burnt down, with all within them, in one of which a man that was thraſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hardly made his eſcape; Among others a youth being overtaken in the ſtorm, endeavoured to ſhelter himſelf in a Windmil, but the ill-natured Miller be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſwear and curſe at him, asking him, if he was ſuch a Fool and changling to be afraid of a little Lightning and Thunder; the boy had ſcarce time to anſwer before he was ſtruck off the ſtairs, and the Miller was forced to go down and take him up half dead; but this unkind Miller had hardly recovered the Youth, ere he himſelf was ſtruck down with the Thunder, and taken up without any appearance of Life for the preſent, though it is ſaid he afterward recovered.</p>
            <p n="84">LXXXIV. There is likewiſe a Relation of a ſtrange Accident which happened this year 1680, at a Town called <hi>Blois</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> That about one a Clock in the morning an amazing Tempeſt of Wind aroſe with ſuch violence, as ſoon affrighted the moſt ſleepy from their repoſe, and in a ſhort time by its fury beat or blew down all the Body of the Church of St. <hi>Soulucas,</hi> except the Belfry; alſo half the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Church, and two fair houſes into the Highſtreet, the People where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were glad to run into the arched Cellars to ſave themſelves, which they happily did, for the ruins fell upon, and round about the Arch, but the Rubbiſh being removed, they were afterward drawn out alive, This Tempeſt was likewiſe accompanied with a moſt prodigious Hail, many Thouſand ſtones being found as big as a mans Firſt, which without ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority would ſeem incredible; This unuſual Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven broke all the Slates wherewith the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are covered, and the Glaſs Windows all over the Town, as if they had been beaten in a Mortar; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Town eight whole Pariſhes with the Fields adjacent were wholly ruined by the Hail in ſuch a terrible manner, that it ſeemed as if no Corn had
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50774:101"/>been ſown, or Vines planted there; There were four other Pariſhes much indamaged, and multitudes of Chimneys beaten down, ſo that the dammages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with the breaking of Windows and Tiles was valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be above Two Hundred Thouſand Crowns, and the harm in the Vineyards and Cornfeilds invaluable; But it pleaſed God the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church in that Town was wonderfully preſerved, though equally expoſed to the Weather; without a Slate or any glaſs broken, the direful marks of the Tempeſt being viſible round about it; The ſame Divine Providence was ſeen in that neither Man, Woman, nor Child were killed in this dreadful deſolation: There likewiſe happened an unuſual Accident upon a Ship riding at Sea, which being attaqued by a furious Tempeſt, was in great danger of being caſt away; but on a ſudden there broke ſo dreadful a clap of Thunder into the Ship, that they all imagined their Guns had been acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally fired, and in a moment the main Maſt was ſplit in ſunder from top to bottom, as you would ſplit a ruſh; the main top Maſt was ſhivered into ſmall Peices, and the Pendant at the head of it, was burned to Aſhes; the violence thereof was ſo great, that it beat down fourteen men upon the Deck, and had like to have thrown them into the Sea; and thoſe that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Deck, were likewiſe thrown down, Five of them lay for dead a conſiderable time, no Pulſe or Breath being perceived, their Eyes and Teeth immoveable, yet they had no viſible hurt or wound, only an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſmell of Brimſtone; about half an hour after by rubbing, forcing open their Mouths, and powring down ſome Cordials, they all recovered, but ſeemed much diſturbed in their Senſes; At the ſame time there were ſix others miſerably burnt, their fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcorched, and yet their Garments not ſo much as ſinged, their skin was much diſcoloured, and lookt as if burnt by a Coal.</p>
            <p n="85">LXXXV. In <hi>June</hi> this year 1680, in <hi>Pomerania</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> great and dreadful ſtreams of Fire were ſeen

Though, as an Ingenious Gentleman lately obſerves, there may be much doubt and queſtion whether there be any great certainty in theſe Predictions, ſince they have been judged ſometimes to portend evil as well as good, for as he ſays, Though that Comet which ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to preſage <hi>Luthers</hi> preaching againſt Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Reformation which followed, beſpoke evil it may be to the Popes Kitchen, yet it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the dawning of the Bleſſed Light of the Goſpel to the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of Chriſtendom; But however, (as he adds) if the terrorand rareneſs of theſe Prodigies do upon any Account whatſoever mind us of our Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and prepare us for our end (as it hath effected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome in former Ages) or to reflect upon our own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or the publick Crimes, which may call down Gods; vengeance upon us, and to implore his mercy and fors

            <p>HAving related a multitude of <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Prodigies of Nature.</hi> I ſhall now proceed to thoſe of Art; The <hi>Chineſes</hi> look upon themſelves as the wiſeſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the face of the Earth, they uſe therefore to ſay, <hi>That they ſee with both Eyes, and all other Nations but with one only,</hi> and thereupon they boaſt, though I know not with what Truth and Juſtice that the moſt famous Inventions which have been ſo lately known to us in <hi>Europe,</hi> have been no Strangers to them for many Ages paſt; however I ſhall relate
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50774:107"/>what are moſt obſervable both in theſe and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is likewiſe recorded, that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> having ſeveral ways adorned and fortifyed the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> putting it into a condition of bravery and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for after times, he thereupon gloried, <hi>That he found</hi> Rome <hi>of brick, and left it of Marble;</hi> and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing makes more for the juſt Glory of a Prince than to leave his Dominions in better State than he found them; Yet the vaſt Expences of ſome Princes and People had been more truly commendable, and their mighty works more really glorious, had they therein conſulted more of the Publick good, and leſs of their own Oſtentation; However it may not be unpleaſant, nor unprofitable to deſcribe them, and likewiſe to relate the moſt curious Inventions and Rarities in all Ages even to theſe times, which have been more favourable to Learning than the former, and wherein Arts have been thereby improved to the height;</p>
            <p n="1">1. But firſt concerning Buildings, the moſt famous ſtructure we firſt read of, was immediately after the Univerſal Deluge, or <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, for <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Son of <hi>Chus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> perſwaded the People to ſecure themſelves from the like after-claps by building ſome ſtupendious Edifice, which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the fury of a ſecond Deluge; This Counſel was generally imbraced; <hi>Heber</hi> only and his Family (as the Tradition goes) contradicting ſuch an unlawful attempt; But the major part prevailing, the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> began to rear its Head of Majeſty Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand One Hundred Forty ſix Paces from the Ground, having its <hi>Baſis</hi> and circumference equal to its height: The Paſſage to go up went winding about the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and was of an exceeding great breadth, there being not only room for Horſes, Carts, and the likemeans of Carriage to meet and turn, but lodgings alſo for Man and Beaſt; And (as <hi>Verſlegan</hi> reports) Graſs and Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields for their nouriſhment; and admirable it is to conſider, what multitudes of men there were in the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50774:108"/>World in ſo ſhort a ſpace, there being but eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that came out of the Ark, and now this Building was carried on by Five Hundred Thouſand Men, the Foundation of it was nine miles compaſs; But God by the Confuſion of Tongues hindred the Proceeding of this Building, one not being able to underſtand what his Fellow called for; which <hi>Du Bartas</hi> witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribes.</p>

            <p>The Degrees by which men aſcend, are not all of an equal depth, for ſome are about four foot, others ſcarcely three, and the higher they aſcend, the more they diminiſh both in bredth and thickneſs; Theſe are all made of maſſy and poliſhed Stones, the bredth of every ſtep being one ſingle and intire Stone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thirty foot of ſtone, the number of theſe ſteps is two hundred and ſeven; On the North-ſide aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 38 feet upon an Artificial Bank of Earth, there is a ſquare and narrow Paſſage leading into the inſide

It is divided from the former by a Wall, at the end whereof is a Well about three foot over; the ſides of which are lined with white Marble; it is eighty ſix Cubits in depth, hewn through the Rock where the <hi>Pyramid</hi> ſtands; About 15 foot thence, is a ſquare Paſſage of mighty Stones, exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely joined, containing one hundred and 10 foot, at the end of which is an Arched Vault, or little Chamber, the length about twenty foot, and bredth ſeventeen; The length of this ſecond Gallery is 154 feet of white and poliſhed marble, both roof, Walls and bottom, and on each ſide benches of the ſame.</p>
            <p>At the end of this Gallery you enter into a ſquare hole, which brings you in a little room lined with rich and ſpeckled <hi>Theban</hi> Marble, out of which through another Paſſage of the ſame ſtone moſt curiouſly cut, you come to the North end of a very ſumptuous and well proportioned Room, wherein Art ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with Nature, the curious work not being inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Rich Materials; It ſtands in the heart or center of the <hi>Pyramid,</hi> the floars, ſides, and roof all of excellent <hi>Theban</hi> Marble; The Stones which cover this room are of a ſtrange ſtupendious length, like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny huge beams lying flat croſs the room, and bearing up that almoſt infinite weight, and maſs of the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids

            <p>The Tomb is cut ſmooth and plain, without any ſculpture or ingraving; The outſides contain in length 7 Foot, 3 Inches and half; in depth 3 foot, 4 Inches, and the ſame breadth, the hollow part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is about ſix foot long, the depth two foot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that mens bodies are as big now as they were Three Thouſand year ago, for it is near ſo long ſince this Tomb was made; The charge whereof was ſo great, that though the workmen had no other Food but Garlick, Radiſhes and Onions, yet it coſt that King eighteen Hundred Talents. Some with great labor and pains have climbed to the top of this Pyramid, but being above, they have ſeemed as it were to loſe their ſight by looking down, judging themſelves to be above the clouds, whereby their Brains were much troubled; Next to this in bulk and beauty, is ſaid to be the Pyramid of a Daughter of <hi>Cheops,</hi> who, as Authors report, to finiſh her Fathers undertaking, and raiſe her own to the height, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted her body to all Comers, requiring but one ſtone toward the work from each one of her Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; <hi>Treaſury of Time.</hi>
