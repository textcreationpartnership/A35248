            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>STrange and Wonderful have been the Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Productions of Nature in all Ages, or rather of the God of Nature, and Divine Providence: St. <hi>Auflin,</hi> that Famous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father of the Church, defineth Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be tho≈øe things which happen beyond the Expectation, or thought of the Beholder, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets in him a Miraculous Contemplation, yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times horrour and amazement; whereof there are two kinds, True and Fal≈øe; the fal≈øe Miracles are ≈øuch as are not really as they ≈øeem to be, but meerly acted by the Power of Nature, although ob≈øcure and hid; The True are performed by the Power of God, above and beyond all the Faculties of created Nature, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to procure Admiration, and partly to confirm the Faith of Men; ≈øuch were the bringing back of the ≈øhadow Ten Degrees in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> for <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> A Virgin to conceive with Child, and yet remain a Virgin: To draw water out of a hard Rock: To cau≈øe the Sea to divide a≈øunder; The Sun to ≈øtand ≈øtill: To cau≈øe Manna to fall from Heaven: To turn Water into Wine; and many of the like kind recorded in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50774:4"/>the Holy Scriptures; And the≈øe were formerly u≈øed for the Confirming of the Faith both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øtians;</hi> but are not now nece≈ø≈øary, ≈øince the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets, Evangeli≈øts and Apo≈øtles are ≈øo generally preached unto all.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That the World had never but Three true Religions, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which had a Prophet; Fir≈øt God cho≈øe the</hi> Jews, <hi>and did wonders for them in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and brought them forth by their Prophet</hi> Mo≈øes, <hi>who pre≈øcribed them a Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would have maintained them, if they had not been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinate and rebellious, and fallen to Idolatry, whereupon he gave them over, and ≈øcattered them upon the face of the Earth; Then pre≈øently after God rai≈øed a new Prophet, who taught the Chri≈øtian Religion: This good man the</hi> Jews <hi>condemned, and Crucified for a Seducer of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being not moved with the piety of his Life, his great

About the beginning of <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> 1669, there came two Whales and a Grampas up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> whereof one of the Whales, and the Grampas were killed, and the other Whale which was the bigger, returned back into the Sea; <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 4. following, ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> news was brought to our Kings Maje≈øty of the Death of the Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The≈øe Fires have broke forth in ≈øeveral Ages of the World, to the great terror and de≈øtruction of the Inhabitants, and all the adjacent Countreys; As in the year of the world 2600 when the Po≈øterity of <hi>Janus</hi> went to ≈øeek new Colonies, they fir≈øt entred <hi>Sicily,</hi> where at that time there was ≈øo great a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mountain, that the new Planters leaving the I≈øland for fear of De≈øolation, went to ≈øeek new habitations in <hi>Italy;</hi> after them followed the <hi>Sicane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were likewi≈øe driven away from the≈øe Ea≈øtern Parts, to the We≈øtern by the≈øe dreadful <hi>Aetnean</hi> burnings. In the year of the world 3180, and for above four hundred years after, this Mountain was all on fire with three huge burnings; A little after the Mountain raging anew, it is ≈øaid to have drawn <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> him≈øelf into the highe≈øt admiration; Al≈øo in the Reign of <hi>Hero,</hi> at which time Hi≈øtories deliver that <hi>Empedocles</hi> an Ob≈øerver of the Mountain was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed. In the time of <hi>Julius Cae≈øar,</hi> about fifty years before Chri≈øt, <hi>Diodorus</hi> relates, That <hi>Aetna</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mo≈øt violently, which they ≈øaid portended the Death of <hi>Cae≈øar;</hi> It is reported to have been ≈øo great, that the Sea with its fervour and boyling heat burnt even the very Ships, even as far as the <hi>Vulcanello</hi>'s, All the Fi≈øh being de≈øtroyed and boyled to death; yea within twenty years, the Mountain burnt four times. In the Reign of <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> forty nine years after Chri≈øt, the Mountain raged ≈øo, that the Emperor at that time in <hi>Sicily</hi> was ≈øo affrighted, that he betook him≈øelf to ≈øafer ≈øtations; yet they relate, that the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> out of the greatne≈øs of his mind did a≈øcend the Mountain very far to con≈øider more nearly ≈øuch great Miracles; In ≈øeveral Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it made woful irruptions, as from the year 1160, to 1169, all <hi>Sicily</hi> was ≈øhaken with huge Earthquakes,

               <hi>In my Voyage from</hi> Malta <hi>to this place, I touched at the City of</hi> Catania <hi>in</hi> Sicily, <hi>and was there mo≈øt kindly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the Bi≈øhop to lodge in his Palace, which I accepted, that ≈øo I might be the better able to inform your Maje≈øty of that extraordinary Fire which comes from Mount</hi> Gibel, 15 <hi>miles di≈øtant from that City; which for its horridne≈øs in the a≈øpect, for the va≈øt quantity thereof, (for it is</hi> 15 <hi>miles in length, and</hi> 7 <hi>in breadth) for its mon≈øtrous deva≈øtation and quick progre≈øs, may be termed an Inundation of Fire, a Flood of Fire, Cinders and burning Stones, burning with that Rage as to advance into the Sea</hi> 600 <hi>yards, and that to a mile in breadth, which I ≈øaw; and that which did augment my admiration was, to ≈øee in the Sea this matter like ragged Rocks, burning in ≈øour fathom water, two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom higher than the Sea it ≈øelf; ≈øome parts liquid and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and throwing off, not without great violence, the ≈øtones about it, which like a cru≈øt of a va≈øt bigne≈øs, and red hot, ≈øell into the Sea every moment, in ≈øome place or other, cau≈øing a great and horrible noi≈øe, ≈ømoak and hi≈ø≈øing in the Sea; and thus more and more coming after it, making a firm foundation in the Sea it ≈øelf. I ≈øtayed there from nine a Clock on Saturday morning, to ≈øeven next morning, and this Mountain of Fire and Stones, with Cinders, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the Sea</hi> 20 <hi>yards at lea≈øt, in ≈øeveral places; in the middle of this Fire, which burn'd in the Sea, it

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From this River of Fire (under the great Ma≈ø≈øe of the Stones which are generally three fathom high all over the Country, where it burns and in other places much more,) there are ≈øecret Conduits or Rivulets of this liquid matter, which Communicate Fire and heat into all parts more or le≈øs, and melts the Stones and Cinders by fits in tho≈øe places where it toucheth them, over and over again; where it meets with Rocks or Hou≈øes of the ≈øame matter (as many are) they melt and go away, with the Fire; where they find other compo≈øitions they turn them to lime or a≈øhes, (as I am informed,) The compo≈øition of this Fire, Stones and Cinders, are Sulphur, Nitre, Quick-≈øilver, Sal-Armoniac, Lead, Iron, Bra≈øs, and all other Mettals. It moves not regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor con≈øtantly down hill; in ≈øome places it hath made the Valleys Hills, and the Hills that were not high are now Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.

            <p>Whil'≈øt the People were thus bu≈øied in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and a≈øtoni≈øht by their Fears, News was brought to the Magi≈øtrates of the City, that a con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of Thieves and Robbers had taken the opportunity of this general Di≈øtraction, to make a Prey of the already di≈øtre≈ø≈øed People, and that they had murdered ≈øeveral of them for their Goods; and that it was to be fear'd, that the City of <hi>Catania</hi> it ≈øelf, might run ≈øome danger from the great numbers of them which were about the Country, and from thence took their opportunities to get into the Town.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50774:96"/>Whereupon, con≈øultation being had for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of farther mi≈øchief from them, the Commander of the Ca≈øtle was ordered with a con≈øiderable number of Hor≈øe, and a Party of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to ≈øecure the Country and City again≈øt the≈øe Robbers; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ≈øent out ≈øeveral Parties with his Provo≈øt-Mar≈øhal, with Order to ≈øeize on all ≈øu≈øpected Per≈øons, and ≈øuch as were not able to give a good account of them≈øelves: and, for ≈øuch as were taken in the Fact Robbing, to Execute them by Martial-Law, without any farther Tryal; and accordingly cau≈øed three pair of Gallowes to be ≈øet up for their ≈øpeedy Execution; one before the Gate <hi>Di Aci,</hi> a ≈øecond in the <hi>Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,</hi> and a third before the Gate <hi>Della Decima,</hi> ≈øetting ≈øtrong Guards upon the Gates of the City, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing all ≈øu≈øpected Hou≈øes to be ≈øearched, an Account to be given in of all Lodgers, and ≈øuch Per≈øons to be ≈øecured, as could any ways fall under a Su≈øpition.

All the Elements ≈øeemed at this time to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and to con≈øpire together for the puni≈øhment of the Inhabitants; The Air was continually darkened with Clouds and Smoke, agitated by great and violent

            <p>The Sea ran much higher than it was wont to do, and by its extraordinary Roaring, and in ≈øome places over-flowing its Banks, added not a little to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øternation.

            <p>On Friday the 15th. the ≈øtream of fiery Matter which de≈øtroyed the lower part of St. <hi>Giovanni di Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo</hi> divided it ≈øelf into two parts, one of its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches taking its way toward <hi>Mo≈øterbianco,</hi> the other threatning the City of <hi>Catania,</hi> but this la≈øt was ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to move with more ≈ølowne≈øs than before, having in 24 hours time ≈øcarcely gained 20 paces.</p>
            <p>On the 18th being Monday, the Torrents being ≈øtill ≈øeen to draw nearer and nearer to this City, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with Mon≈øegnior <hi>Cambuchi</hi> the Bi≈øhop of this place, followed by all the Clergy Secular and Regular, and an infinite number of people went in a ≈øolemn Proce≈ø≈øion out of this City to <hi>Monte de St. Sofia,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying out with greate≈øt Devotion their choice≈øt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and upon an Altar erected in view of the Mountain, expo≈øed them, where they celebrated Ma≈øs and u≈øed the Exorci≈ømes accu≈øtomed upon ≈øuch extraordinary occa≈øions, all which time, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cea≈øed not as before with exce≈ø≈øive roaring to throw up its ≈ømoak and flames with extraordinary violence, and abundance of great ≈øtones, which were carried through the Air, ≈øome of them falling within
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50774:97"/>their view, though at ten miles di≈øtance from the Eruption; the A≈øhes which proceeded from thence were ≈øcattered in great abundance, as well on this City as on the Country adjacent, every where in the Fields with Cinders, and the heat of the ≈øaid A≈øhes de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gra≈øs, which obliged the people to drive away their Cattle to a farther di≈øtance, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe have peri≈øhed for want of food.</p>
            <p>The≈øe ≈øtreams of ruine dayly crept nearer and nearer to this City, but by uneven and irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according as it was more or le≈øs ≈øupplyed from its fountain; but on Wedne≈øday the 20th. we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that that branch of it which ≈øeemed mo≈øt to threaten this City from St. <hi>Giovanni di Galermo</hi> was wholly extingui≈øht, and the other which bent its cour≈øe toward <hi>Mo≈øter-bianco</hi> ran but ≈ølowly, and gave us ≈øome hopes that its fury was al≈øo near ≈øpent, but the other Torrent which had before overflown <hi>Mo≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianco,</hi> continued its motion with as much violence as ever, being in breadth above a Mu≈øquet ≈øhot over; but in probability could not ea≈øily overflow to the We≈øtwards which was defended by its Rocky ≈øcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; another branch which ran by <hi>Santo Pietro</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved to be much larger than the re≈øt, and its ≈øtream more quick and active, but meeting with ≈øome oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition in its way, it made ≈øome ≈øtop, only ≈øending out a Rivulet toward the Ea≈øtwards about three or four yards wide, of its mo≈øt ≈øubtle and active matter, which directed its cour≈øe towards a ≈ømall Village about a Furlong di≈øtant from its main ≈øtream; another Branch threatned <hi>Campo Rotundo,</hi> but bent its cour≈øe we≈øtwards towards the Farm of <hi>Valcorrente,</hi> where its Fiery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ≈øcattered into ≈øeveral deep and rocky places, without any con≈øiderable damage.</p>
            <p>About this time we had hopes that the violence of this eruption had been over, the Mountain not throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out its flames with that violence as before, and its noi≈øe and roaring in a great mea≈øure cea≈øed.</p>
            <p>Tho≈øe who at neare≈øt di≈øtance took a view of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50774:97"/>Mountain, informed that the top of it, was fallen in, and the Mountain ≈øuppo≈øed to want near a mile of its former height; that the large≈øt of the Mouths from whence the≈øe fiery ≈øtreams were vented, was about half a mile in compa≈øs, but the view of this dreadful Inundation carried ≈øo much terror in it as they were not able to expre≈øs; from all the≈øe Mouths were vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Rivers of a thick and fiery ≈øub≈øtance of ≈øtone and metals melted, who≈øe depth was various accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ≈øeveral places it filled in its pa≈ø≈øage, in ≈øome places 4, in others 8, 12 or 15 yards and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; its breadth in ≈øome places 6 miles, in others much more; itsflame like that of Brim≈øtone, and its motion like that of Quick-≈øilver; advancing ordinarily very ≈ølowly, unle≈øs where it was provoked by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a fre≈øh Torrent or ≈øome con≈øiderable de≈øcent. Where≈øoever it pa≈ø≈øed, it left large heaps of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed matter, with which it covered and burnt the Earth, melting the Walls of Ca≈øtles and Hou≈øes, throwing down and con≈øuming all before it, nothing being yet found able to re≈øi≈øt its force, nor any thing able to quench its burning, water being ob≈øerved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to add to its fury; where≈øoever it has pa≈ø≈øed, it has left its dreadful marks behind it, levelling ≈øome hills and rai≈øing others, ≈øo much changing the ≈øcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that not the lea≈øt trace of any place or Town remains, nothing being to be ≈øeen but confu≈øed heaps of ragged ≈øtone, which yielding a noi≈øome fume, ≈øtrikes terror and a≈øtoni≈øhment into all that behold it.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 22, the Mountain again roared with much loudne≈øs, and threw up from its Mouths a va≈øt quantity of matter, which formed two large hills higher and larger than that of <hi>Monpileri,</hi> with a large bank of the ≈øame matter to the Ea≈øtward, ≈øending down a violent ≈øtream of its liquid matter towards <hi>Malpa≈ø≈øo,</hi> much enlarging the former Current, and pa≈ø≈øing thence to <hi>Campo Rotundo</hi> and <hi>Santo Pietro</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the ruines of tho≈øe Towns, driving furiouflyi towards <hi>Mo≈øter bianco;</hi> the other ≈øtream by <hi>Santo Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni

From this time till the 25th, the Mountain continued ≈øilent, but then it bur≈øt out again with more force than ever before, its noi≈øe much louder, like Peales of Ordnance, and ≈øo forcible and la≈øting, as for 24 hours it cau≈øed a ≈øhaking and trembling in our Buildings, the Air ≈øo filled with Smoak and A≈øhes, as darkned the Face of the Sky. The Birds and Fowl about this time, either through want of Food, or illne≈øs of Air, which was corrupted with the noi≈øome ≈ømells ari≈øing from the≈øe Burnings, were ob≈øerved to lye dead in all places.</p>
            <p>On the 28th. the Grand Current was advanced near the City as far as the old <hi>Capucins.</hi> which ≈øtruck ≈øo great a Terror into the People, that mo≈øt of them left the City, only ≈øome Officers remaining with ≈øuch per≈øons as were under their command, who have ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ≈øent away the <hi>Magazine</hi> and all the Artillery from the Ca≈øtle.</p>
            <p>A Latter Relation from <hi>Catania,</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 27. gives this further Account, The dreadful Inundation from <hi>Monte Gibello</hi> having de≈øtroyed many <hi>Ca≈øtles</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> with an infinite lo≈øs, and utter ruine to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, arrived lately with a renewed Force at <hi>Mo≈øtor-bianco,</hi> which it has wholly ruin'd, from thence pa≈ø≈øing on to <hi>Albanelli,</hi> in four days ≈øpace de≈øtroyed all the Gardens and Vineyards with 63 Thou≈øand Vines.

With an Impetuous Fiery Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it came towards <hi>Sardanello,</hi> where all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Inhabitants of this City were Spectators of it, which re≈øembled a River of melted and burning Bra≈øs, about ten Ells wide, running with ≈øwiftne≈øs to the Arch of <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> a famous Piece of Antiquity, and pa≈ø≈øing under it, ruin'd about 6 Ells of it, which was the breadth of the Current in that place: from thence it ran to <hi>Madonna di Monferrato,</hi> which it wholly de≈øtroyed: then falling down to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna delle Gratie,</hi> it entred in at one Gate, and pa≈ø≈øed through another, without any con≈øiderable hurt, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50774:98"/>running through the Gate <hi>Della Decima,</hi> filled all the Plain <hi>Di Schiara Viva,</hi> where it was above ≈øix Ells deep.
